# Paper Revision Tool Restructuring Progress

## Completed Components

1. **Core Module**
   - `context.py`: Created a RevisionContext class to hold shared state 
   - `interactive.py`: Extracted interactive mode functionality
   - `constants.py`: Moved constants and shared configurations
   - `json_utils.py`: Created utilities for JSON parsing
   - `paper_revision.py`: Created a stub for the main PaperRevisionTool class

2. **Budget Module**
   - `budget_manager.py`: Created a BudgetManager class to manage token and cost budgets

3. **Set up module structure**
   - Created directory structure for all modules
   - Added __init__.py files with proper exports
   - Created a new entry point (paper_revision_v2.py)

## Next Steps

1. **Document Module**
   - Extract document generation functionality
   - Implement methods for creating various documents
   - Create document formatting and output generation

2. **Analysis Module**
   - Extract paper analysis functionality
   - Implement reviewer comment analysis
   - Create issue identification and solution generation

3. **References Module**
   - Extract reference validation and updating
   - Implement BibTeX handling
   - Create citation management

4. **Evaluation Module**
   - Extract quality evaluation functionality
   - Implement cross-model comparison
   - Create feedback generation

## Benefits of the Restructuring

1. **Improved Maintainability**
   - Smaller, focused modules
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Easier to understand and extend

2. **Reduced Analysis Limits**
   - Files are now much smaller
   - AI assistants can easily analyze individual components
   - Avoids context limits during development

3. **Better Dependency Management**
   - Dependencies are clearly defined
   - State is shared through the RevisionContext
   - Modules communicate through well-defined interfaces

4. **Enhanced Testing**
   - Modules can be tested independently
   - Easier to mock dependencies
   - Clearer test boundaries

## Compatibility

The restructuring maintains backwards compatibility:
- The command-line interface remains the same
- The overall functionality is preserved
- The output formats and directories remain consistent

## Current Status

Initial framework set up. The code structure is in place, but the implementation of specific functionality within each module is still to be completed.

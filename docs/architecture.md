# Paper Revision Tool Architecture

This document describes the architecture of the Paper Revision Tool, providing an overview of the system design, component interactions, and key architectural decisions.

## Architectural Overview

The Paper Revision Tool follows a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns, loosely based on Domain-Driven Design principles. The system is designed to be maintainable, extensible, and testable.

### Architectural Layers

The system is divided into the following layers:

1. **Domain Layer** (`src/domain/`): Contains the core domain entities, value objects, and domain services
2. **Service Layer** (`src/services/`): Implements application use cases using domain entities
3. **Adapter Layer** (`src/adapters/`): Provides interfaces to external systems (LLMs, PDFs, DOCX, etc.)
4. **Core Layer** (`src/core/`): Contains cross-cutting concerns and infrastructure components
5. **Configuration Layer** (`src/config/`): Manages application configuration
6. **Error Handling Layer** (`src/errors/`): Provides centralized error handling mechanisms
7. **Utilities** (`src/utils/`): Reusable utility functions and classes

### Key Components

#### Domain Layer

The domain layer contains the core business entities and logic. It is designed to be independent of technical concerns like persistence or UI.

- **Paper**: Represents an academic paper with sections, references, and metadata
- **ReviewerComment**: Encapsulates reviewer feedback and suggestions
- **Issue**: Represents a problem identified in the paper
- **Solution**: Represents a proposed solution to an issue
- **Change**: Represents a specific textual change to implement a solution
- **Reference**: Represents a bibliographic reference
- **Assessment**: Represents an assessment of the revision impact

#### Service Layer

The service layer implements application-specific use cases and orchestrates domain objects.

- **PaperService**: Analyzes papers and extracts structured information
- **ReviewerService**: Analyzes reviewer comments and editor requirements
- **SolutionService**: Identifies issues and generates solutions
- **DocumentService**: Creates various output documents
- **ReferenceService**: Validates and updates references
- **LLMService**: Provides a clean abstraction over LLM interactions

#### Adapter Layer

The adapter layer isolates the application from external systems and libraries.

- **PDFAdapter**: Handles PDF file reading and writing
- **DocxAdapter**: Handles DOCX file reading and writing
- **LLMAdapter**: Abstracts interactions with LLM APIs
- **BibTeXAdapter**: Handles BibTeX parsing and formatting

#### Core Layer

The core layer provides infrastructure and cross-cutting concerns.

- **RevisionContext**: Shared context that holds state across components
- **PaperRevisionTool**: Main orchestrator class
- **Factory**: Creates and configures components

#### Configuration Layer

The configuration layer manages all application settings.

- **AppConfig**: Central configuration class with validation
- **ConfigManager**: Loads and manages configuration
- **Environment**: Handles environment variables

#### Error Handling Layer

The error handling layer provides consistent error management.

- **PaperRevisionError**: Base exception class
- **ErrorHandler**: Central error handling mechanism
- **ErrorReporter**: Reports errors to various outputs
- **RecoveryStrategies**: Strategies for recovering from errors

## Component Interactions

### Data Flow

1. **Input Processing**:
   - PDF and text files are processed by adapters
   - Structured information is extracted into domain entities

2. **Analysis Flow**:
   - Paper and reviewer comments are analyzed by services
   - Issues are identified based on reviewer comments
   - Solutions are generated for issues
   - Specific changes are proposed to implement solutions

3. **Output Generation**:
   - Document services create output files
   - Changes are applied to the original paper
   - Assessment documents are generated

### Key Interaction Patterns

#### Context-Based Component Initialization

Components are initialized with a shared `RevisionContext` that provides:
- Configuration settings
- Logger
- Process statistics
- Input/output paths
- Factory methods

```python
# Example context-based initialization
class PaperService:
    def __init__(self, context: RevisionContext):
        self.context = context
        self.logger = context.logger or logging.getLogger(__name__)
        # Initialize adapters and repositories
```

#### Factory-Based Component Creation

The `ServiceFactory` centralizes component creation logic, ensuring proper initialization:

```python
# Example factory usage
paper_service = service_factory.get_paper_service()
paper = paper_service.analyze_paper()
```

#### Interface-Based Design

Services implement interfaces to enable substitution and testing:

```python
class DocumentService(DocumentServiceInterface):
    def create_changes_document(self, changes, output_path):
        # Implementation...
```

## Design Patterns

The Paper Revision Tool uses several design patterns to address common architectural challenges:

### Factory Pattern

Used to create service and adapter instances with proper dependencies.

**Implementation**: `src/services/factory.py` and `src/core/factory.py`

### Repository Pattern

Used to abstract data access logic for domain entities.

**Implementation**: `src/repositories/interfaces.py` and implementations

### Strategy Pattern

Used for algorithm selection, particularly in the budget optimization and LLM selection.

**Implementation**: `src/core/patterns.py` and budget strategies

### Adapter Pattern

Used to convert between external systems and internal domain models.

**Implementation**: All classes in `src/adapters/`

### Facade Pattern

Used to provide simplified interfaces to complex subsystems.

**Implementation**: `PaperRevisionTool` class

### Observer Pattern

Used for event notification, especially for process statistics and logging.

**Implementation**: `src/core/patterns.py`

### Command Pattern

Used for encapsulating operations as objects.

**Implementation**: `src/core/commands.py`

## Extension Points

The Paper Revision Tool is designed to be extensible. Key extension points include:

### Service Interfaces

New service implementations can be created by implementing service interfaces:

```python
# Create a new document service
class CustomDocumentService(DocumentServiceInterface):
    def create_changes_document(self, changes, output_path):
        # Custom implementation...
```

### LLM Providers

New LLM providers can be added by:
1. Adding a new model file in `src/models/`
2. Implementing the provider's API client
3. Registering the provider in the factory

### Document Formats

New document formats can be supported by:
1. Creating a new adapter in `src/adapters/`
2. Implementing read/write operations
3. Registering the adapter in the factory

### Recovery Strategies

New error recovery strategies can be added by:
1. Creating a recovery function in `src/errors/recovery.py`
2. Registering the strategy for specific error types

## Configuration System

The configuration system is designed to be flexible and support multiple sources:

1. **Command-line arguments** (highest precedence)
2. **Environment variables** (with `PAPERREVISION_` prefix)
3. **Configuration files** (YAML/JSON)
4. **Default values** (lowest precedence)

### Configuration Structure

```
AppConfig
├── LLMConfig
│   ├── provider: str
│   ├── model_name: str
│   └── verify_model: bool
├── BudgetConfig
│   ├── budget: float
│   └── optimize_costs: bool
├── FileConfig
│   ├── original_paper_path: str
│   ├── reviewer_comment_files: List[str]
│   └── editor_letter_path: Optional[str]
└── OutputConfig
    ├── output_dir: str
    └── formats: List[str]
```

## Error Handling Architecture

The error handling system provides a consistent approach to errors:

1. **Custom Exception Hierarchy**: All exceptions inherit from `PaperRevisionError`
2. **Centralized Error Handling**: The `ErrorHandler` class manages error handling
3. **Error Reporting**: Multiple reporting mechanisms (console, file, logging)
4. **Recovery Strategies**: Strategies for recovering from different error types

### Error Flow

1. Error occurs in a component
2. Error is caught and converted to a `PaperRevisionError` type
3. Error is passed to the error handler
4. Error handler applies appropriate strategies
5. Error is reported through configured channels
6. Recovery is attempted if possible

## Dependencies

The Paper Revision Tool has the following key dependencies:

1. **Language Model APIs**:
   - Anthropic Claude API
   - OpenAI API
   - Google Vertex AI

2. **Document Processing**:
   - PyPDF2 for PDF parsing
   - python-docx for DOCX processing
   - pdfminer for deep PDF analysis

3. **Academic APIs**:
   - Scopus API for reference validation
   - Web of Science API for citation analysis

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Management

- Large documents are processed in chunks
- Streaming APIs are used when available
- Temporary files are cleaned up after use

### Concurrency

- LLM requests can be made concurrently
- File processing is single-threaded to avoid resource contention
- Budget tracking uses thread-safe operations

## Security Considerations

### API Keys

- API keys are loaded from environment variables or secure storage
- Keys are never logged or included in error reports
- Keys are validated before use

### File Access

- File paths are validated and normalized
- Temporary files use secure creation patterns
- Output directories have proper permissions

## Deployment Architecture

The Paper Revision Tool is designed for local deployment with the following considerations:

1. **Environment**: Runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows
2. **Dependencies**: Managed through pip and requirements.txt
3. **Configuration**: Uses .env files for environment-specific settings
4. **Logging**: Configurable logging to files and console

## Testing Architecture

The testing approach includes:

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
3. **Service Tests**: Test service layer functionality
4. **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete workflows

Tests are organized to mirror the package structure:

```
tests/
├── unit/
│   ├── domain/
│   ├── services/
│   └── adapters/
├── integration/
└── e2e/
```

## Version Evolution

The Paper Revision Tool follows semantic versioning:

1. **Major Version**: Incompatible API changes
2. **Minor Version**: New features in a backward-compatible manner
3. **Patch Version**: Backward-compatible bug fixes

### API Stability

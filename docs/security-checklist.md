# Security Checklist for Paper Revision System

This checklist is designed to help developers and maintainers ensure security best practices are followed in the Paper Revision System. It should be consulted before deploying changes or as part of a regular security audit.

## API Key Management

- [ ] No API keys are hardcoded in source code
- [ ] All API keys are stored using the secure credential manager
- [ ] API keys have been rotated within the last 90 days
- [ ] API key validation is performed before use
- [ ] API keys are properly scoped with minimal permissions

## Database Security

- [ ] All database queries use parameterized statements
- [ ] All user-supplied table/column names are sanitized
- [ ] Database error messages don't leak implementation details
- [ ] Database files have proper permissions (600/700)
- [ ] Database connection uses secure configuration options

## Input Validation

- [ ] All user inputs are validated
- [ ] File paths are validated before use
- [ ] Command-line arguments are validated
- [ ] API inputs are validated
- [ ] All validation errors are handled gracefully

## Error Handling

- [ ] Custom exceptions are used for different error types
- [ ] Error messages don't leak implementation details
- [ ] Full stack traces are only logged to secure locations
- [ ] Error responses use appropriate HTTP status codes
- [ ] All unexpected exceptions are caught and handled

## File Security

- [ ] File access is restricted to intended directories
- [ ] Temporary files are created securely and cleaned up
- [ ] File permissions are set appropriately
- [ ] File operations validate paths before execution
- [ ] Uploaded files are scanned or validated

## Dependency Management

- [ ] All dependencies are up to date
- [ ] Dependencies are scanned for known vulnerabilities
- [ ] Dependency sources are verified
- [ ] Unused dependencies are removed
- [ ] Dependencies are pinned to specific versions

## Logging and Monitoring

- [ ] Sensitive data is masked in logs
- [ ] Log levels are appropriate (debug in development, info/warn in production)
- [ ] Error logs are monitored for security issues
- [ ] Authentication attempts are logged
- [ ] API key usage is logged for audit purposes

## Authentication and Authorization

- [ ] API endpoints have appropriate authentication
- [ ] User roles and permissions are enforced
- [ ] Session management is implemented securely
- [ ] Password policies are enforced (if applicable)
- [ ] Failed authentication attempts are rate-limited

## Code Security

- [ ] Security-focused code reviews are conducted
- [ ] Static analysis tools are run on code
- [ ] Security unit tests are implemented
- [ ] Unused code is removed
- [ ] Commented-out code is removed

## Deployment Security

- [ ] Production environments use different API keys than development
- [ ] Debug/development features are disabled in production
- [ ] Appropriate firewall rules are in place
- [ ] TLS/SSL is properly configured
- [ ] Environment variables are properly set

## Documentation

- [ ] Security documentation is up to date
- [ ] Security incident response plan exists
- [ ] Vulnerability reporting procedure is documented
- [ ] Secure development practices are documented
- [ ] API security requirements are documented

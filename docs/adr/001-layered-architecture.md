# ADR-001: Layered Architecture

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The paper revision tool was initially implemented as a monolithic class with over 3,000 lines of code and more than 40 methods. This led to several problems:

- The code was difficult to understand and maintain
- Business logic was tightly coupled with infrastructure concerns
- Testing was challenging due to the lack of separation of concerns
- Extending the system with new functionality required modifying the monolithic class
- The Single Responsibility Principle was violated throughout the codebase

We needed an architectural approach that would enable better separation of concerns, improved testability, and enhanced maintainability.

## Decision

We decided to adopt a layered architecture with the following layers:

1. **Domain Layer**: Contains the core domain entities, value objects, and domain services
2. **Service Layer**: Implements application use cases using domain entities
3. **Adapter Layer**: Provides interfaces to external systems (LLMs, PDFs, DOCX, etc.)
4. **Core Layer**: Contains cross-cutting concerns and infrastructure components
5. **Configuration Layer**: Manages application configuration
6. **Error Handling Layer**: Provides centralized error handling mechanisms
7. **Utilities**: Reusable utility functions and classes

Each layer has a specific responsibility and may only depend on layers below it. Interfaces are used to define clear boundaries between layers.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Improved maintainability**: Each component has a single responsibility
- **Enhanced testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
- **Better separation of concerns**: Business logic is separated from infrastructure
- **Increased extensibility**: New functionality can be added without modifying existing code
- **Clearer dependencies**: Dependencies between components are explicit and manageable

### Negative

- **Initial implementation overhead**: Designing and implementing the layered architecture takes more upfront effort
- **Increased complexity**: The overall system architecture is more complex than a monolithic approach
- **Learning curve**: New developers need to understand the layered architecture and its conventions
- **Performance overhead**: The additional layers may introduce some performance overhead due to indirection

## Alternatives Considered

### Keep Monolithic Approach with Better Organization

**Pros**:
- Simpler implementation
- No additional indirection overhead
- Easier to understand the entire system

**Cons**:
- Does not address the fundamental issues of coupling
- Testing would remain challenging
- Extensibility would still be limited

### Microservices Architecture

**Pros**:
- Even clearer separation of concerns
- Independent deployment of components
- Better scalability

**Cons**:
- Excessive complexity for this type of application
- Deployment and operational overhead
- Network communication overhead
- This is a desktop application, not a distributed system

## Implementation

The layered architecture is implemented through the following directory structure:

```
src/
├── domain/        # Domain entities and value objects
├── services/      # Application services and use cases
├── adapters/      # External system adapters
├── core/          # Cross-cutting concerns
├── config/        # Configuration management
├── errors/        # Error handling
└── utils/         # Utility functions and classes
```

Each layer follows these implementation guidelines:

1. Define interfaces for all components
2. Use dependency injection for cross-layer dependencies
3. Minimize dependencies between components within the same layer
4. Use factories to create and configure components

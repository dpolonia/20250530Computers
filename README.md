# Paper Revision System

A system for analyzing, revising, and improving academic papers based on reviewer comments using state-of-the-art language models.

## Features

- Automated paper analysis and understanding
- Reviewer comment processing and categorization
- Solution generation for addressing reviewer concerns
- Revision implementation with tracked changes
- Citation verification and improvement
- Multi-model support (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Required Python packages (see `requirements.txt`)
- API keys for at least one of the supported LLM providers:
  - Anthropic Claude
  - OpenAI GPT
  - Google Gemini

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/paper-revision-system.git
   cd paper-revision-system
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -r security_requirements.txt
   ```

4. Initialize security settings:
   ```bash
   python scripts/initialize_security.py
   ```

5. Configure API keys:
   ```bash
   python scripts/manage_credentials.py store anthropic
   # Follow the prompts to enter your API key
   ```

### Usage

#### Command Line Interface

```bash
python paper_revision.py --original-paper path/to/paper.pdf --reviewer-comments path/to/comments.pdf --provider anthropic --model claude-3-opus-20240229
```

#### Interactive Mode

```bash
python paper_revision.py --interactive
```

## Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest --cov=src
```

Generate a test report:

```bash
python scripts/generate_test_report.py
```

## Architecture

The system is built with a modular, maintainable architecture:

- **Interface-based design**: Components are defined by interfaces for loose coupling
- **Dependency injection**: Dependencies are injected rather than hard-coded
- **Factory pattern**: Component creation is managed by factory classes
- **Service layer**: Business logic is encapsulated in service classes
- **Repository pattern**: Data access is abstracted through repositories

Introduction\n33\n34\nIn the era of digital transformation, many sectors such as finance, telecommunica-\n35\ntions, healthcare and public administration are under increasing pressure to modernise\n36\nlegacy systems to keep up with the incorporation of new advanced technologies and sus-\n37\ntain a competitive advantage [1]. However, over the past few decades, due to the retire-\n38\nment of the original developers and key stakeholders of these systems, coupled with a\n39\nlack of available domain experts and the complexity of transitioning legacy systems to\n40\nAcademic Editor: Firstname Last-\nname\nReceived: date\nRevised: date\nAccepted: date\nPublished: date\nCitation: To be added by editorial\nstaff during production.\nCopyright: \u00a9 2025 by the authors.\nSubmitted for possible open access\npublication under the terms and\nconditions of the Creative Commons\nAttribution (CC BY) license\n(https://creativecommons.org/license\ns/by/4.0/).\nComputers 2025, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW\n2 of 19\nnewer technologies [2], knowledge sharing has become a critical driver of innovation [3].\n41\nRecent studies have reinforced these findings, highlighting the need for substantial mod-\n42\nifications to legacy IT infrastructures, particularly to address data privacy concerns and\n43\nto mitigate the lack of specialised skills, which hinders the conversion of tacit knowledge\n44\ninto explicit knowledge \u2013 a fundamental process for sustaining long-term viability [4].\n45\nThis is particularly relevant in sectors such as finance in developing countries, where leg-\n46\nacy systems persist and cybersecurity resilience relies increasingly on the adoption of ad-\n47\nvanced technologies like AI and machine learning (ML) [5]. Empirical research suggests\n48\nthat migrating legacy software is a better approach than discarding it and building new\n49\nsoftware in its place. However, this migration does not guarantee the correctness and\n50\ncompleteness of the legacy system, and it may take time to gain the confidence of users\n51\n[6]. Recognising these challenges, academics have explored strategies for migrating a leg-\n52\nacy system, but outline that at the time of publication of their study, there was no struc-\n53\ntured approach to supporting developers in the complex activities of a migration process\n54\n[7]. Some practitioners believe that cutting-edge technologies, such as generative AI, could\n55\nhelp governments address the significant operating risks associated with the retirement\n56\nof available workers with knowledge on outdated programming languages, such as\n57\nCOBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language), but this is not yet a consensual idea [8].\n58\nTo encourage researchers to rethink solutions in AI-related areas and to generate\n59\nfresh evidence and new insights that bridge the gap between theory and practice, there\n60\nhave been several calls for papers from top-tier journals, such as \u201cHuman-computer in-\n61\nteraction\u201d form Informatics (ISSN 2227-9709) which leads us to believe that AI tools can\n62\nplay an important role in shaping the knowledge ecosystem [9].\n63\nDespite the growing academic interest of academic in AI applications and ap-\n64\nproaches to modernising legacy IT systems, particularly COBOL-based platforms, there\n65\nhas been little research into how AI, integrated with Agile methodologies, can enhance\n66\nthe modernisation of these systems, which remain dependent on a 60-year-old computer\n67\nprogramming language. While renowned companies such as IBM are at the forefront of\n68\nmany current developments, including new mainframes, academic engagement with\n69\nCOBOL is declining as students and teachers lose interest in the language, so universities\n70\nmust to continuously challenge them to keep up with the pace [10]. It also seems that there\n71\nis a greater need for real-world use cases and user histories than for theoretical debates\n72\n[11]. However, theoretical studies can be important to support new research.\n73\nThis unique relationship between the importance of a grounded theoretical approach\n74\nand practical recommendations reveals a clear research gap: the need for a deeper under-\n75\nstanding of the pros and cons of AI and Agile methodologies in overcoming the limita-\n76\ntions of static and highly resilient legacy architectures. This study addresses this gap by\n77\ninvestigating the landscape of COBOL-based legacy systems, with a particular focus on\n78\nthe real-world case of DOGE, an initiative of the second Donald Trump administration in\n79\nthe United States, whose goal is \u201cmodernising federal technology and software to max-\n80\nimize governmental efficiency and productivity\u201c [12]. Rather than relying solely on con-\n81\nceptual analysis, this research uses a dual-source literature approach to ensure a compre-\n82\nhensive understanding of both scientific and practical perspectives:\n83\n1.\nScientific literature: This study integrates scientific articles on Agile methods,\n84\nwith a particular focus since the publication of the Agile Manifesto in 2001 [3], alongside\n85\nstudies on AI applications on legacy systems.\n86\n2.\nGrey literature and industry insights: To include practical perspectives, this re-\n87\nsearch examines technology magazines, industry reports, and expert analysis, such as\n88\nMIT Technology Review articles [13].\n89\nThis approach set this study apart by analysing a real-life scenario of a government\n90\ndepartment that is facing controversy for delayed IT modernisation efforts. By examining\n91\nComputers 2025, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW\n3 of 19\nthis case, this study assesses the positive and negative outcomes of legacy systems man-\n92\nagement, explores the role of AI and agile methodologies, and outlines future research\n93\ndirections for more actionable modernisation strategies.\n94\nThe article is structured into five sections: First, the author presents an overview of\n95\nthe topic, including the main studies that support the research, research gaps and research\n96\nobjectives. Next, the core concepts of legacy modernisation are defined. This is followed\n97\nby the methodology section, which details the systematic literature review and the inclu-\n98\nsion of grey literature to provide practical insights. The results of the literature review and\n99\na case study are then discussed. Finally, theoretical and practical implications, recommen-\n100\ndations for organisations, research limitations, and future research directions are pre-\n101\nsented.\n102\n2. State of the art\n103\nIn this section, the state of the art in legacy systems and COBOL-based infrastructures\n104\nis examined, with a particular focus on modernisation challenges and the integration of\n105\nAI tools and Agile methodologies, based on a systematic literature review. Key frame-\n106\nwork such as AI-driven decision support systems [14], modular AI architecture for anom-\n107\nalies detection [15], and Agile-based iterative modernisation models will be explored to\n108\nhighlight structured approaches to legacy system transformation [16]. Finally, based on\n109\ngrey literature will be used to analyse the DOGE case.\n110\n2.1. Defining legacy systems and COBOL-based software\n111\nA legacy system is defined as an \u201colder software application that uses an obsolete\n112\nhardware and software platform which is hard and expensive to maintain and integrate\n113\nwith modern systems\u201d [17]. Despite their increasing obsolescence, legacy systems con-\n114\ntinue to play an important role in multiple sectors, particularly in financial and govern-\n115\nmental institutions [18]. As recently highlighted by [19], the maintenance of legacy soft-\n116\nware, often developed in COBOL, is a critical and necessary effort as it contains the im-\n117\nportant business logic. The authors emphasise that this modernisation can be challenging\n118\nand requires an deep understanding of system behaviour, stating that \u201cit is necessary to\n119\ncompletely understand the behaviour of components in relation to their interfaces, i.e.,\n120\ntheir interface protocols, and to preserve this behaviour during the maintenance activities\n121\nof the components\u201d [19].\n122\nWhile some modernisation strategies focus on replacing legacy systems, others ad-\n123\nvocate for extending their lifespan through incremental improvements. Authors such as\n124\n[20] argue that legacy systems do not necessarily need to be replaced; instead, their effec-\n125\ntive life can be extended by integrating new technologies such as the Internet of Things\n126\n(IoT) and AI. However, there are several approaches to modernising legacy systems in the\n127\nliterature. [17] explore the use of artificial neural networks to enhance data processing and\n128\nfraud detection while preserving the core business logic embedded in financial legacy\n129\nsystems. In contrast, [18] propose a system re-engineering approach, transitioning a mon-\n130\nolithic architecture to a new microservice architecture, aiming to reduce complexity,\n131\nachieve lower coupling and higher cohesion, and simplify integration.\n132\nLegacy systems present different levels of complexity and integration challenges, of-\n133\nten categorised according to their adaptability and compatibility with modern technolo-\n134\ngies. Fully monolithic systems pose the greatest modernisation challenges due to their\n135\nrigid structure; whereas postmodern systems have been incrementally updated through\n136\nenterprise-wide coordination, allowing them to evolve with internal and external require-\n137\nments while integrating newer technologies [21]. In this regard, [22] refer that in 2019,\n138\nmany agencies that supported the COVID-19 response relied on outdated legacy systems\n139\n(stand-alone electronic systems), which struggled to handle the increased demand for\n140\nComputers 2025, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW\n4 of 19\ndigital services and rapid data processing, so they had to accelerate their efforts to mod-\n141\nernise these systems.\n142\nCOBOL remains one of the most enduring programming languages in legacy sys-\n143\ntems, with at least 20 billion lines of code still in use worldwide, representing 43% of all\n144\nbanking systems in the US in 2017 [23]. However, its monolithic structure and outdated\n145\ndesign make modernisation complex, requiring programme abstraction and Agile ap-\n146\nproaches to support the redevelopment and improvement of the system [3].\n147\n2.2. Legacy systems, AI tools and Agile methodologies\n148\nBased on a comprehensive review, [14] highlights the extensive applications of AI\n149\ntechniques in revolutionising traditional approaches in IT infrastructures, particularly in\n150\n(a) improving accuracy [24], (b) reducing operational costs [25], and (c) enhancing deci-\n151\nsion making [15]. According to Elahi [14] also characterise modernisation strategies for\n152\nlegacy systems, characterise AI-driven data processing, predictive maintenance, and au-\n153\ntomated decision support with AI-generated insights. In this regard, [25] highlights how\n154\nAI-enhanced real-time monitoring improves the efficiency of legacy system operations by\n155\nreducing response times to failures and optimising resource allocation. However, [26] ex-\n156\nplains that despite these advances, the biggest challenge remains the integration of new\n157\ntechnologies with the legacy infrastructure, as most organisations are required to com-\n158\npletely restructure their classical systems or find a way to ensure successful integration.\n159\nTo address this concern, [27] uses a real-world case study of a legacy banking system to\n160\ndescribe how the challenge previously highlighted by Asif, Ghanem and Irvine [26], can\n161\nbe addressed by leveraging Agile methodologies so that organisations can make incre-\n162\nmental adjustments and continuously assess requirements to mitigate technical risks.\n163\nA central challenge is the epistemological gap between COBOL\u2019s structured Water-\n164\nfall approach and Agile\u2019s constructivist paradigm [28]. COBOL development is rooted in\n165\npositivist epistemology, emphasising linear processes, rigid documentation, and pre-de-\n166\nfined requirements. This results in codified but static knowledge, making it difficult to\n167\nadapt to evolving business needs. Agile methodologies, on the other hand, operate within\n168\na constructivist epistemology, where knowledge is continuously refined through collabo-\n169\nrative problem-solving, iteration, and team-based learning.\n170\nThe shift from Waterfall to Agile is not just a technical transition but a fundamental\n171\nchange in how knowledge is created, shared, and retained. Catherine et al. [29] show in a\n172\nreal case that modernising COBOL-based legacy banking systems that COBOL experts to\n173\nrely on extensive documentation and structured workflows, while Agile promotes tacit\n174\nknowledge transfer through practices like pair programming and cross-functional collab-\n175\noration. This collaboration is important for preventing the loss of institutional knowledge,\n176\nparticularly as COBOL-experienced professionals retire.\n177\nTerry and Chandrasekar [16] developed a structured Agile lifecycle model to support\n178\nthe evolution of legacy systems into an enterprise by iteratively refining requirements and\n179\nmanaging complexity during system transformation. AI-assisted abstraction tools can\n180\nsupport this transition by automating system abstractions and generating target code in\n181\nmultiple languages/platforms while preserving the core functionality of legacy infrastruc-\n182\ntures [3].\n183\nIn the case study by Sullivan [22], adopting an Agile approach with constant real-\n184\ntime feedback from end users in a high-pressure modernisation scenario, such as the\n185\nCOVID-19 pandemic, is key to successful outcomes. However, the integration of AI tools\n186\ninto legacy infrastructures raises data privacy concerns, as AI-driven automation requires\n187\nextensive access to historically sensitive information [30]. These challenges are particu-\n188\nlarly evident in the case of DOGE, which is presented in the next section.\n189\nComputers 2025, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW\n5 of 19\n2.3. DOGE legacy systems characterisation\n190\nAfter establishing the key concepts and discussing the main theoretical foundations\n191\nin Sections 2.1 and 2.2, this section provides the empirical context for the research by char-\n192\nacterising the controversial initiative by Elon Musk\u2019s DOGE team to modernise govern-\n193\nment IT systems, which has spawned opposition and lawsuits [31]. This analysis is partic-\n194\nularly relevant for practitioners and academics seeking to understand the technological\n195\ncharacteristics of DOGE\u2019s COBOL-based infrastructure as well as its modernisation chal-\n196\nlenges and broader implications.\n197\n2.3.1. COBOL-based legacy systems and modernisation challenges: The case of DOGE\n198\nA notable example of an organisation with a sense of urgency to modernise legacy IT\n199\nsystems is the DOGE department, led by Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy in 2024 [32]. The\n200\ninitiative began in mid-2024, when Elon Musk proposed a \"government efficiency com-\n201\nmission\" to Donald Trump, which later evolved into DOGE, which was officially estab-\n202\nlished by Executive Order 14158 in January 2025 to consolidate agencies, cut costs, and\n203\nmodernise outdated IT systems with AI-driven alternatives [33]. Musk began highlighting\n204\nthe urgent need for this modernisation on social media in 2024, saying, \u201cThe government\n205\nruns on ancient computers & software. Needs an upgrade!\u201d [34], and shared a Govern-\n206\nment Accountability Office (GAO) report from  2023 that revealed that several federal\n207\nagencies still rely on outdated and obsolete IT systems using older languages such as\n208\nCOBOL, some of which exceeding 50 year old in operation [32], [35].\n209\nThe urgency of this matter is reflected in previous GAO assessments. According to\n210\nthe GAO report in 2019 [35], ten critical federal agencies were identified as most in need\n211\nof modernization in 2019, but only two agencies had documented modernisation plans\n212\nthat included three key elements: (i) milestones to complete the modernization, (ii) a de-\n213\nscription of the work necessary to modernize the legacy system, and (iii) details regarding\n214\nthe disposition of the legacy systems. By 2023, six of the remaining eight agencies had\n215\nimplemented modernisation plans based on GAO\u2019s recommendations, leaving the De-\n216\npartment of Transportation and the Office of Personnel Management as the only agencies\n217\nwithout fully developed plan.

For instance, Burman [36] highlights\n226\nthat legacy COBOL infrastructures continue to pose significant operational challenges at\n227\nthe Social Security Administration (SSA), which is being victim of a scrutiny that revealed\n228\ncritical errors in beneficiary records, including cases where people over the age of 150\n229\nwere still listed as beneficiaries due to flaws in data processing errors. These issues led the\n230\nauthor to set the goal of analysing more closely the impact of outdated systems on gov-\n231\nernment processes and regulated industries, particularly DOGE.\n232\nHowever, concerns about modernisation efforts go beyond operational inefficiencies.\n233\nThe MIT Technology Review article, published in February 2025 [13], warns that DOGE\u2019s\n234\nmodernisation strategy, while ambitious, has raised significant security risks by eliminat-\n235\ning key oversight mechanisms. The so-called \u201cEvil Housekeeper Problem\u201d, which states\n236\nthat \u201conce someone is in your hotel room with your laptop, all bets are off\u201d, is used an\n237\nanalogy to illustrate how DOGE\u2019s the risks associated with DOGE\u2019s decision to remove\n238\nthe Authority to Operate (ATO) process, which allowed unauthorised individuals to make\n239\nunauthorised changes to government systems.\n240\nIn parallel with these modernisation efforts, according to Shrivastava [37], DOGE has\n241\nbegun to use AI models to optimise government operations, particularly in workforce\n242\nmanagement and the processing of large amounts of sensitive data. Kube et al. [38] ex-\n243\nplained that this initiative is controversial because DOGE pretends to evaluate the produc-\n244\ntivity of government employees based on a Large Language Model (LLM) by asking em-\n245\nployees to self-report what they got done in the last week via email, while AI determines\n246\nwhich roles are redundant. Such initiatives could represent a first step in modernising\n247\nlegacy systems by helping to improve reporting and data processing, but they also raise\n248\nserious concerns about the reliability and fairness of AI-driven decision-making in gov-\n249\nernment [39].\n250\nThis approach is in line with DOGE\u2019s \u201cAI-first strategy\u201d perspective, as highlighted\n251\nby Thomas Shedd\u2019s recent comments to General Service Administration staff, and rein-\n252\nforces the administration\u2019s push to restructure government agencies to operate like\n253\n\u201cstartup software companies\u201d [40]. The plan is to deploy AI widely across the federal gov-\n254\nernment,  using AI capabilities to analyse contracts for redundancies, root out fraud, and\n255\nautomate much of the work to facilitate a reduction in the federal workforce [41]. The\n256\ninitiatives have brought in skilled technologists to work with federal agencies, incorpo-\n257\nrating best practices from the private sector, such as Agile development, which empha-\n258\nsises iterative development, continuous feedback loops, and user-centred design [42].\n259\nThese advances in the public sector should be viewed with caution, considering that\n260\nthey require a high level of interaction, particularly in data-sensitive services [43]. There-\n261\nfore, in line with other researchers, we also advocate the need for deeper empirical re-\n262\nsearch to critically assess the effectiveness of integrating AI and Agile methodologies to-\n263\ngether in legacy system modernisation.\n264\n3. Materials and Methods\n265\nThis study follows a systematic literature review based on PRISMA guidelines to\n266\nachieve the aim of providing the best possible evidence to inform academics and organi-\n267\nsations, while employing a \u201creplicable, scientific and transparent process\u201d [44]. As shown\n268\nin Figure 1, Scopus was chosen because of its vast coverage of peer-reviewed articles [45]\n269\non Agile methodologies and AI applications compared to other similar databases such as\n270\nScienceDirect and Web of Science. The decision to use a single source database was made\n271\nbecause the priority of this study is to achieve a level of transparency that allows other\n272\nComputers 2025, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW\n8 of 19\nresearchers to easily reproduce the results.

Figure 1\n277\nfurther supports the relevance of the research topic and the time period chosen, as the\n278\nnumber of publications related to legacy systems and COBOL has grown exponentially\n279\nover the last few decades, with a particularly sharp increase in the last five years.\n280\n281\nFigure 1.

Perspectives in legacy system modernisation: results from the systematic literature review\n321\nThe modernisation of legacy systems, particularly COBOL-based infrastructures,\n322\npresents challenges that go beyond technical limitations, extending into epistemological,\n323\norganisational, and operational concerns [28]. While AI and Agile methodologies offer\n324\nsolutions, integrating them into rigid legacy systems requires overcoming barriers related\n325\nto knowledge retention, system interoperability, cybersecurity, and organisational adap-\n326\ntation [1], [14]. In this regard, studies such as DOGE, which is trying to have a more mod-\n327\nern footprint while addressing the talent deficit of COBOL experts, have attracted atten-\n328\ntion in newspapers and industry blogs, but there is still a notable lack of academic research\n329\non these topics, likely due to the novelty of the issue.\n330\nIt is evident that legacy system modernisation involves many different approaches,\n331\nintegrating AI tools and Agile methodologies, leading to widespread discussion within\n332\nthe academic community. In this regard, the author has identified three generic points of\n333\nview:\n334\n1.\nOptimistic view: Elahi et al. [14] conducted research to investigate how AI enhances\n335\nthe migration of legacy systems towards modernisation through AI-based decision\n336\nmaking. Their results suggest that the strategic implementation of AI enables organ-\n337\nisations to achieve higher productivity and cost effectiveness. AI-driven knowledge\n338\nautomation helps mitigate skill shortages, ensuring knowledge extraction from leg-\n339\nacy systems can be automated and leveraged for modern development.\n340\n2.\nCautious view: Other scholars take a more measured stance, recognising AI\u2019s benefits\n341\nbut warning about cybersecurity vulnerabilities and interoperability risks in the in-\n342\ntegration phase [25]. Ntafalias et al. [25] found that AI-driven interoperable architec-\n343\ntures for integrating legacy systems can significantly improve operational efficiency\n344\nby automating knowledge extraction and streamlining data flows, but ensuring\n345\nseamless compatibility with existing infrastructures remains a challenge.\n346\n3.\nSceptical view: The most sceptical positions point out that while AI and Agile meth-\n347\nodologies hold promise, their full potential in large-scale legacy system modernisa-\n348\ntion remains uncertain due to unresolved issues such as scalability, standardisation,\n349\ndata sharing, and interoperability, as many proposed frameworks are still at the pilot\n350\nstage [26].\n351\n352\nNerur, Mahapatra and Mangalaraj (2005) developed a comparative framework con-\n353\ntrasting the positivist epistemology underpinning Waterfall with the constructivist para-\n354\ndigm of Agile [28]. Waterfall methodologies depend on structured workflows, predeter-\n355\nmined phases, and extensive documentation to ensure system predictability, yet they lack\n356\nadaptability. In contrast, Agile fosters adaptability, continuous feedback, and collabora-\n357\ntive decision-making through dynamic knowledge creation. However, transitioning from\n358\nWaterfall to Agile poses risks to institutional knowledge retention. Nerur, Mahapatra and\n359\nMangalaraj (2005) argue that hybrid models combining structured documentation with\n360\nAgile\u2019s iterative learning cycles can maintain system integrity while fostering adaptability\n361\n[28]. Lano et al. [3] highlight that Agile fosters collaboration between legacy system\n362\nComputers 2025, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW\n11 of 19\nexperts and development teams, ensuring knowledge retention and mitigating the risks\n363\nof workforce attrition in COBOL-based infrastructures.\n364\nSeveral researchers have proposed solutions to mitigate these challenges. Terry and\n365\nChandrasekar [16] introduced a structured Agile lifecycle model designed to facilitate leg-\n366\nacy system evolution while maintaining knowledge retention. Their framework incorpo-\n367\nrates iterative requirement refinement, allowing legacy systems to transition gradually\n368\nwithout compromising documentation integrity. Lano et al. [3] extended this approach by\n369\nproposing AI-assisted abstraction techniques to automate code migration while maintain-\n370\ning system integrity. Their research highlights that while AI-driven abstraction tools ac-\n371\ncelerate modernisation, they must be complemented by structured oversight mechanisms\n372\nto prevent technical debt and system instability. Meanwhile, Brataas et al. [27] proposed\n373\na knowledge-sharing model that leverages Agile practices such as pair programming and\n374\ncross-functional collaboration to bridge generational gaps between COBOL experts and\n375\nmodern developers, reducing workforce transition risks.\n376\nAs Wang et al. [1] note, the financial sector provides a critical example of how AI and\n377\nAgile methodologies are shaping legacy system modernisation. Their research outlines\n378\nhow cloud computing, big data analytics, and blockchain have revolutionised financial\n379\nservices, enabling greater scalability and automation. However, they emphasise that rapid\n380\ndigitalisation introduces cybersecurity risks, regulatory compliance challenges, and in-\n381\nteroperability constraints.\n382\nIn summary, as the urgency to modernise legacy infrastructures grows, AI-driven\n383\ntools and frameworks are being developed and, in this regard, researchers have increas-\n384\ningly focused on the complexities of technological adoption and regulatory compliance.  385\nConcomitantly, the number of investigations has grown (Figure 1) in order to explore so-\n386\nlutions for modernising legacy systems; however, these studies have primarily examined\n387\nspecific technological approaches tailored to individual systems rather than providing a\n388\nholistic assessment of the advantages and limitations of existing frameworks for organi-\n389\nsations [14].\n390\nTable 3 summarises Section 4.1, highlighting that AI-driven decision-making opti-\n391\nmises modernisation and reduces costs. However, cybersecurity, interoperability, and or-\n392\nganisational adaptation challenges persist. Most authors advocate a structured, cautious\n393\napproach, integrating AI and Agile while ensuring compliance with security and govern-\n394\nance standards.\n395\nTable 3.

Hy-\nbrid models are needed\n397\n4.2. The DOGE Case: incorporating insights from grey literature analysis\n398\nAs noted in Section 2.3, the Department of Government Efficiency embarked on an\n399\nambitious initiative to nuke bureaucracy across US federal government departments, to\n400\nmodernise legacy IT systems that are \u201coutdated or obsolete\u201d [32]. However, DOGE ended\n401\nup removing key security mechanisms, such as ATOs, leaving no practical technical\n402\nmeasures to prevent unauthorised individuals from taking a spanner to the technology\n403\nthat keeps the government stable [13]. Understandably, this situation led to frustration\n404\namong experts. Despite these concerns, DOGE has continued with its \u201cAI-first\u201d strategy,\n405\nwhich aims to make government agencies operate like a \u201cstartup software company\u201d in\n406\nline with the principles of the Agile Manifesto [40]. For example, according to anonymous\n407\nsources, the use of AI tools such as ML is becoming common practice in DOGE to analyse\n408\nhuge amounts of text data to understand, generate and process human language [38].\n409\nAlthough DOGE has faced criticism, the push for AI-driven modernisation should\n410\nnot be completely dismissed, but rather re-evaluated. Compared to the traditional ap-\n411\nproaches, the integration of AI tools, such as the General Services Administration (GSA)\n412\nchatbot, can streamline administrative tasks (e.g., email drafting and document analysis),\n413\nimprove fraud detection in contract reviews, and increase the accessibility and respon-\n414\nsiveness of government services [43].\n415\nIn this section, the aim is to discuss DOGE's modernisation efforts in the light of AI-\n416\ndriven automation and Agile methodologies at two levels (technical and organisational),\n417\nas well as the associated pros and cons, as shown in Table 4.\n418\nThe author will consider the following dimensions:\n419\n\u2022\nSecurity & compliance;\n420\n\u2022\nSystem interoperability;\n421\n\u2022\nKnowledge retention & workforce;\n422\n\u2022\nAI-driven decision making;\n423\n\u2022\nCost efficiency & bureaucratic optimisation.\n424\nTechnical level: AI-driven modernisation in DOGE has significantly improved system\n425\ninteroperability, enabling seamless data exchange between legacy COBOL-based infra-\n426\nstructures and modern platforms. AI-driven automation has optimised fraud detection\n427\nand administrative processes, reducing inefficiencies and increasing accuracy. However,\n428\nthe removal of oversight mechanisms, such as the ATO process, has weakened cyberse-\n429\ncurity and created vulnerabilities that could be exploited. Furthermore, while AI-driven\n430\nworkforce assessments offer efficiencies, they lack contextual understanding, raising con-\n431\ncerns about biased assessments and misclassification of employee performance. For this\n432\nreason, a structured AI framework is critical to ensure system reliability and mitigate the\n433\nrisks associated with automation.\n434\nOrganisational level: The integration of AI and Agile methodologies has introduced\n435\ngreater adaptability, enabling refinement of government operations. However, the rapid\n436\nand unstructured implementation of AI has created inconsistencies across departments,\n437\ndisrupted knowledge transfer and led to resistance from employees who perceive auto-\n438\nmation as a threat to job stability. Relying on AI to assess employees has also raised ethical\n439\nconcerns, as automated decisions risk overlooking tacit knowledge and human expertise.\n440\nA hybrid approach, in which AI complements rather than replaces human decision-mak-\n441\ning, would ensure that DOGE modernises effectively while preserving institutional\n442\nComputers 2025, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW\n13 of 19\nknowledge, upholding ethical standards and fostering balanced human-AI collaboration\n443\nwithin the organisation.\n444\nIn summary, the results show that DOGE\u2019s AI-driven modernisation has improved\n445\nefficiency by automating processes and enhancing system interoperability, particularly in\n446\nCOBOL-based legacy systems where expertise is already scarce. By using new technolo-\n447\ngies such as AI to address legacy system issues, DOGE is trying to reduce the dependence\n448\non a reduced pool of COBOL and outdated language experts. However, the rapid and\n449\nunstructured adoption of AI has also raised concerns about knowledge sharing and hu-\n450\nman-AI collaboration, as automation alone cannot fully replace the tacit knowledge em-\n451\nbedded in legacy systems [14], [27]. Unlike the traditional waterfall approach for system\n452\ndevelopment, which follows a rigid, sequential structure that limits adaptability, the Agile\n453\napproach facilitates iterative improvements and continuous adaptations to new require-\n454\nments, making it more suitable for modernising legacy infrastructures [16], [3]. Ensuring\n455\nthat AI complements human expertise, rather than replacing it entirely, is crucial for fos-\n456\ntering sustainable digital government operations. Aspects related to such concerns may\n457\nbe a target for future research.\n458\nTable 4.

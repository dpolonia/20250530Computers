Abstract: This paper discusses the “Get Real Get Better” (GRGB) approach to implementing agile
program management in the U.S. Navy, supported by advanced data analytics and artiﬁcial intel-
ligence (AI). GRGB was designed as a set of foundational principles to advance Navy culture and
support its core values. This article identiﬁes a need for a more informed and efﬁcient approach to
program management by highlighting the beneﬁts of implementing comprehensive data analytics
that leverage recent advances in cloud computing and machine learning. The Jupiter enclave within
Advana implemented by the U.S. Navy, is also discussed. The presented approach represents a
practical framework that cultivates a “Get Real Get Better” mindset for implementing agile program
management in the U.S. Navy.
Keywords: program management; data analytics; machine learning; artiﬁcial intelligence; agile
development
1. Introduction
Rapid advances in business applications of data analytics (DA) and artiﬁcial intelli-
gence (AI) have great potential to transform and disrupt the current program-management
capabilities and practices [1–3]. Many recently published studies have demonstrated the
beneﬁts of the effective implementation and integration of data analytics and AI in project
management (see, for example, [4,5]). While most of these studies focused primarily on
project management, Santos and de Carvalho [6] discussed the beneﬁts of scaling agile
project management to large projects. This paper introduces the requirements for leveraging
data analytics and AI to enhance program management in the U.S. Navy environment.
In a fast-evolving world, the United States Navy military consistently strives to stay
ahead by ensuring the efﬁcient execution of complex programs while continuing to meet
mission-critical objectives. To meet these continuing and changing demands, the Navy’s
Chief of Naval Operations established the foundations for a program known as Get Real Get
Better (GRGB) in 2021. GRGB was designed as a set of foundational principles to advance
Navy culture and support its core values. “Get Real” focuses on self-assessment and
transparency. To stay ahead of its near-peer competition, the Navy needs to be continually
self-aware and provide continued assessment regarding its performance. Similarly, “Get
Better” attempts to utilize this self-assessment and commit to improvement. Here, the focus
is on achieving the highest standards of performance.
This paper discusses the Get Real Get Better (GRGB) approach for developing agile
program management in the U.S. Navy. Currently, the Navy seeks to apply advanced data

analytics and artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) to transform program management by identify-
ing and ﬁxing the root causes of its current challenges. At its core, the proposed GRGB
framework leverages data-driven decision making (Get Real) to build program manage-
ment performance (PMP) and evaluation criteria to cultivate an environment of program
management performance improvement (Get Better).
2. Background: Project and Program Management
2.1. Agile Project Management
The agile approach to project management has been extensively used within the
software development sector and manufacturing settings due to the industry’s dynamics
and the need for rapid adaptation to unforeseen changes in business environments [7,8].
However, current agile project management is still limited by the absence of advanced
analytical methods allowing for automated prediction, estimation, planning, resource and
risk management, and decision-making in general [5]. For example, Cabrero-Daniel [9]
conducted an extensive literature review and longitudinal meta-analysis of the retrieved
studies, focusing on integrating artiﬁcial intelligence with agile software development
methodologies and the role of artiﬁcial intelligence and its future applications within agile
software development with a focus on continuous integration and delivery. Furthermore,
Auth et al. [10] proposed a conceptual framework to speed up the potential applications of
artiﬁcial intelligence in the project management area.
2.2. AI-Supported Agile Project Management
Many recent studies have pointed out that modern management faces the challenge
created by potentially disruptive AI applications across entire organizations and their
business processes [1,5], including, among others, organization-speciﬁc AI use cases [11],
software engineering [12], healthcare [13], and medicine [14]. Most recently, Odeh [15]
argued that project managers should take full advantage of AI to transform traditional
project management processes to meet stakeholders’ needs and deliver the desired project
outcome. Furthermore, Bento et al. [16], based on a systematic literature review, pointed
out that the ﬁeld of project management still needs to fully embrace the beneﬁts of AI
technology, and more research and development is required in this direction.
As discussed by Dam et al. [17], the rapid developments in the ﬁeld of artiﬁcial
intelligence (AI) can transform the current practices in agile project management (APM) by
accelerating productivity and increasing project success rates. Such a transformation can be
achieved by assisting project managers through AI-based automation of repetitive and high-
volume tasks, improving project analytics for estimation and risk prediction, and enabling
AI-supported actionable decision-making. The most recent systematic literature review by
Taboada et al. [18] concluded that AI and machine learning (ML) could be very useful in the
management of IT and construction projects by enabling signiﬁcant improvements in project
planning [19], scheduling [20], cost and quality [21], forecasting [22], risk management [23],
and decision-making competences [24–26].
2.3. Human–AI Collaboration in Project Management
According to Abedin et al. [27], AI systems are currently being implanted into var-
ious information systems, including medical diagnostics, health, layout design, human
resources, arts, entertainment, ﬁnancial/credit scoring, and autonomous vehicles. Shang
et al. [28] suggested that AI technologies are underutilized in project management due
to limited support from top management, the absence of organizational readiness, the
high cost of AI implementation and maintenance, and the shortage of personnel trained
in AI. Furthermore, a questionnaire study by Fridgeirsson et al. [29] suggested that the
respondents did not consider artiﬁcial intelligence as a technology that could support
the required human cognitive skills and leadership abilities. However, as pointed out by
Puranam [30], effective human–AI collaborative decision making should be considered
as a problem in organization design based on two different criteria, i.e., (1) specialization,
Technologies 2023, 11, 165
3 of 16
where humans and AI systems perform tasks that they are best at, and (2) multiple learning
conﬁgurations, which consider the ways that humans and AI systems may “learn together”
and use the most relevant knowledge for collaboration.
Some recent studies have shown the success of human–AI teamwork [31] with hybrid
decision making, where the individual strengths of the humans and the AI systems allow
the optimization of the joint decision outcomes. Such collaborative efforts, where the
human–AI team outperforms the individual agents acting separately, are also called hybrid
intelligence [32,33]. Examples of such effective human–AI collaboration include knowledge
work [34], data annotation [35], medical diagnosis [36], mental health [37], and computa-
tionally informed mission planning [38]. Furthermore, the new developments in the theory
of organizational decision-making [39] also suggest effective ways in which the decisions of
organizational members can be combined with AI-based decisions for successful human-AI
teaming and collaboration in the project management area. Finally, it should be noted
that, according to Smolensky et al. [40], the recent developments in neurocompositional
computing [41] will allow us to overcome the limitations of current computing paradigms
and enable building AI systems that exhibit a high level of cognitive abilities, which are
required for the realization of AI-powered project management applications.
2.4. Program Management in the U.S. Navy
This paper describes a practical framework for developing agile program management
in the U.S. Navy. It should be noted that most of the published literature on the applications
of advanced data analytics and AI focuses on project management rather than program
management. However, as pointed out by many studies [42–46], there are signiﬁcant
differences between project and program management. Notably, Lycett et al. [42] noted
that program management is not just a scaled-up version of project management and that
the ”one size ﬁts all” approach to program management is inappropriate in the dynamic
business environment. They also pointed out that while project management is inward-
focused and task-oriented, program management is strategy-focused and represents a
wider organizational view. In that context, program management links the gap between
project delivery and the organization’s strategic planning [43]. For example, program
management in the information technology sector should continually change to uphold
effective alignment with organizational strategies and react to the external environment as
needed to preserve its relevance [44]. On the other hand, managing speciﬁc projects in a
given program requires making decisions to align them with the program goals.
Pellegrinelli [45] also contended that it is important to distinguish project management
from program management, including the related concepts, approaches, and techniques
relevant to each discipline. Concerning the role of managers, Walenta [46] outlined some
key differences between project managers and program managers by noting that (1) project
managers are inward-oriented, while program managers are focused on the outside envi-
ronment; (2) the competencies of successful project managers signiﬁcantly differ from the
competencies of successful program managers; and (3) project managers do not possess
the required knowledge and skills for program management. Furthermore, de Groth [47]
noted that project-oriented organizations use program management to cope with learning
challenges across teams at different organizational levels. To integrate the above concepts,
Thiry [48] proposed a uniﬁed model for learning performance program management that
combines value management with project management.
3. Data-Driven Organizations
3.1. The Power of Data-Driven Decision-Making
There are several recent studies on the benefits of data-driven decision-making, defined
as the process of using data to inform decision-making and validate courses of action [7–9].
Stobierski [10] outlined the advantages of data-driven decision-making, arguing that data
analytics can improve project management outcomes. From a program management
perspective, data-driven decision-making could take many forms. For example, a program
Technologies 2023, 11, 165
4 of 16
ofﬁce might use spending plans to estimate obligations and expenditure rates. These
estimates might then be used to make ﬁscal decisions regarding where to spend money in
future years and how to break down procurement versus research expenditures or develop
new contracts for execution. The important notion is that the data can drive the decision-
making process and positively impact organizational performance. Indeed, as access to
data and the ability to process these data in a more parallel manner become more accessible,
it will become even easier for organizations to adopt a data-driven decision framework.
Data collection and analysis are key to the US Navy’s “Get Better, Get Real” strategy.
Speciﬁcally, the collection of authoritative data drives conﬁdence in the decisions that
are being made to drive programmatic change. Not only do the data help to baseline
where certain program constraints exist, but they also provide traceability with respect
to how changes may impact the organization. Data also reduces the need for intuitive
decision-making, eliminating the inﬂuence of personal bias. By leveraging authoritative
data, a program ofﬁce can fully commit to a particular strategy by having conﬁdence that
this approach will have speciﬁc impacts in a particular area.
3.2. Becoming a Data-Driven Organization
Organizations seeking to become more data-driven need to foster a data-driven cul-
ture [7–10]. This requires the adoption of a mindset that values the insights and use of
authoritative data. Program managers at the Navy can curate this by developing a culture of
“data awareness” by encouraging behaviors that seek to leverage data to drive performance
change. Program managers should also seek to eliminate barriers to accessing authoritative
data as much as possible. As program ofﬁces seek to make this transition from an intuitive
to a data-driven culture, there are several steps that can be taken to ensure this happens in
a manner that facilitates programmatic success. These steps include the following:
Establish an Authoritative Data Lake: Create a centralized database to store and manage
all project-related data, ensuring easy access for program managers (PMs) and other stake-
holders. While there is a need to identify authoritative data sources, the data oftentimes
may not exist or do not exist in the form that is needed for appropriate analyses. In this
case, program managers should seek ways to develop new data pipelines that would allow
for the collection of new and meaningful data;
Develop Data Collection Standards: One potential pitfall for organizations hoping to adopt
a data-driven mindset is the inconsistency in which data are collected and reported. To
avoid this, program managers should seek to implement uniform data collection standards
across different departments, programs, and projects, making it easier to compare and
analyze data. Developing data dictionaries or metadata repositories is critical here. A
data dictionary is deﬁned as a centralized repository of information about data, such as its
meaning, relationships to other data, origin, usage, and format. By posting this information
in an easily accessible location and ensuring the dictionary is available to users across
all levels of the organization, the program ofﬁce can ensure that data are being used in a
reliable and consistent fashion. This also ensures that conclusions drawn from the use of
those data are consistent and explainable to users;
Invest in Data Management Tools: The adoption of a data-driven culture begins with the
consistent use of data management tools. Program managers should equip themselves and
their professionals with data management tools, including machine learning and statistical
modeling techniques, to enable them to derive valuable insights from the collected data. In
addition, organizations should seek out new and meaningful ways to visualize their data.
Data visualization is as critical a part of the data analytic process as any other. End users
simply cannot derive any meaningful interpretation or action from raw data. Visual aids
that emphasize the power of the data, the inﬂuence and impact of the raw data in drawing
speciﬁc conclusions, and that demonstrate trends and patterns in the data are all critical
pieces for data adoption. Visualization tools such as Qlik, Tableau, and even Excel allow
users to convert raw data of any kind and make them more interpretable for stakeholders
at all levels;
Technologies 2023, 11, 165
5 of 16
Encourage a Data-Driven Culture: Finally, organizations should seek to promote a culture
that emphasizes the importance of data-driven decision-making at all levels of the orga-
nization. Organizational leaders should try to avoid situations that encourage intuitive
decision-making and rely more on decision-making processes that allow them to trace
those decisions back to authoritative data. In this case, leading by example will also create
an environment within a program ofﬁce that encourages analytical thinking. The incul-
cation of this framework begins by encouraging those behaviors that are consistent with
data-driven values. This includes providing ongoing training, creating incentives, and
recognizing achievements in data-driven program management.
4. Methodology
The adoption of a data-driven culture can be a key enabler for program managers
willing to transform their organizations. By gathering and properly labeling data for future
programs, the U.S. Navy can experience numerous beneﬁts, including the following:
1.
Enhanced Decision Making: access to well-structured data will allow PMs to gain a
deeper understanding of their programs, helping them to identify potential risks and
opportunities for improvement;
2.
Optimized Resource Allocation: data-driven insights can guide PMs in making more
informed decisions about resource allocation, ensuring that scarce resources are
deployed effectively;
3.
Fostered Collaboration: the availability of relevant data can promote information
sharing and collaboration between different departments and stakeholders, resulting
in more efﬁcient project management and better outcomes;
4.
Improved Accountability: data transparency will improve accountability by enabling
PMs to track progress more accurately, making it easier to identify and address
inefﬁciencies.
4.1. Business Analytics Use Case
In March 2023, the Expeditionary Missions Program Ofﬁce (PMS 408) and Naval Sea
Systems Command (NAVSEA) initiated a use case through Advana Jupiter of the Depart-
ment of the Navy’s (DoN) enterprise data environment [49,50]. Through a partnership
with Advana that includes access to data mining and machine learning engineers, product
managers, full-stack developers, and data visualization experts, PMS 408 sought to create a
shared understanding of organizational metrics through historical, current, and forward-
looking algorithms. The goal of this effort was two-fold: (1) to foster a data-driven decision
culture that allows program managers and analysts at all levels to inform decisions through
authoritative data, and (2) to simplify and automate existing reporting metrics.
To accomplish these goals, a need for reducing qualitative or intuitive decision-making
processes was recognized. This was carried out to increase conﬁdence in programmatic
planning by developing a data-driven framework for planning and execution. This begins
ﬁrst by identifying authoritative data sources that drive programmatic execution. Once
identiﬁed, it was important to understand how these data facilitate or inhibit organizational
performance. At this stage, it was critical to engage with organizational leadership to
understand their goals and how these authoritative data can serve as a proxy for assessment
toward those goals. As with any data-driven environment, it was also important to focus
on those features that aligned most with the strategic vision of organizational leadership.
This should be carried out a priori rather than using a data exploration approach. Such an
approach was encouraged to prevent the Navy from responding to artifacts that might exist
within the data. Consequently, those features that were the true drivers of organizational
performance were identiﬁed. It should be noted, however, that given the breadth and scope
of data pipelines, this could potentially lead to “false positives” and other data artifacts.
Technologies 2023, 11, 165

4.2. Advana Jupiter
With the above-discussed goals in mind, the Navy initiated the creation of a data
analytic dashboard sitting on top of the Advana Jupiter infrastructure [49,50]. Advana
Jupiter serves as the DoN enterprise data hub. Through a tiered “Wisdom of Crowds”
approach, DON Information Data Stewards create disparate data hubs across a variety of
data domains. The integration of these data hubs allows for the aggregation of the most
authoritative and comprehensive view of enterprise data.
It should be noted that the Advana Jupiter provides several inherent advantages over
local or distributed cloud architectures. For example, Jupiter allows for more ﬂexible cloud
computing. Speciﬁcally, Jupiter provides both dedicated and “on-demand” computing
and storage capacity. In addition, Jupiter and its licensed applications allow for a more
robust data pipeline for more efﬁcient data ingestion, processing, and visualization. A
more attractive feature of Advana is the ability to develop speciﬁc queries on new or
existing data. Metadata are stored on Advana and can be accessed via data discovery tools,
technical documentation, and a data catalog. Lastly, Jupiter provides perhaps the most
modern toolset for data analytics in the acquisition enterprise. Tools such as Apache Spark
allow for large-scale data processing that is agnostic to programming languages. For data
analytics, developers have access to tools such as PyTorch and TensorFlow, which allow for
the development and deployment of machine learning algorithms such as deep learning.
PMS 408 has initiated several efforts that leverage the tools within Advana Jupiter to
assist in programmatic development. These efforts are designed to leverage the tools and
algorithms within this environment to provide more quantitative metrics to describe overall
programmatic health in areas including contract performance, requirement traceability, and
portfolio visualizations. For example, the PMS 408 team and its developers have developed
visualizations surrounding portfolio investments using the Qlik business intelligence (BI)
and visualization platform. This tool can be used in areas such as data integration to assist
in importing and integrating portfolio investment data from data sources such as Navy
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) data. Navy ERP captures and manages ﬁnancial data
related to the Navy’s budgeting, accounting, and ﬁnancial transactions. This includes data
related to budget allocation, expenditure tracking, payroll, and ﬁnancial reporting.
Some of the key data sources being integrated into this speciﬁc use case include
procurement data. Here, the system maintains data related to the procurement of goods and
services, including purchase orders, vendor information, contract details, and procurement
history. In addition, models based on asset management data were developed. In this case,
Navy ERP can track and manage assets such as equipment, vehicles, and facilities. This
includes data on asset maintenance, depreciation, and utilization.
Similarly, a focused approach to analyzing data surrounding reporting and analytics
has been adopted. The ERP generates various reports and analytics based on the data
it collects. These reports help Navy leadership make informed decisions about resource
allocation, budget planning, and operational efﬁciency. Taken together, the historical
data were used to build predictive models of future performance. For example, Navy
ERP accumulates historical data that can be used for trend analysis, forecasting, and
performance evaluation. Finally, historical data can provide valuable insights into the
Navy’s ﬁnancial and operational performance.
4.3. The Qlik Platform
For this business use case, data from ERP and other government data on the Qlik
platform were used. This integration allowed the development of data models within
Qlik to organize our portfolio data. These models help to deﬁne relationships between
different data tables, such as investments, asset classes, and performance metrics. This
step is crucial for building meaningful visualizations. A second advantage of the Qlik tool
is that it allows for ease-of-dashboard creation and visualization. Qlik’s drag-and-drop
interface created interactive dashboards that can be updated in near real time. In addition,
users could customize these dashboards to ﬁlter and drill down into the data. Analysts and
Technologies 2023, 11, 165
7 of 16
programmatic leadership can select speciﬁc investments, time frames, or asset classes to
focus on speciﬁc aspects of the portfolio.
Visualizations only represent a small fraction of the capability developed through the
Advana Jupiter business use case. Using additional tools allowed through their secure
government cloud brokerage enabled the Navy to build models that track key performance
indicators (KPIs) to provide additional insights into portfolio performance. Examples
include calculating contract performance deviations, long product delivery delays, and
other hindrances to programmatic performance. Making further use of the Advana pipeline
allowed implementing alerts and notiﬁcations within Advana to automatically alert users
when investments failed to meet predeﬁned criteria or required attention.
Overall, the tools within the Advana pipeline are a catalyst for developing quantiﬁable
models to better understand portfolio performance. This study discussed how it was possi-
ble to use these tools and the Advana platform in the Navy for analysis and visualization
purposes. Such tools provide ﬂexibility and interactivity, making them well-suited for
portfolio managers, ﬁnancial analysts, and resource sponsors who want to gain deeper
insights into their investment portfolios and make informed decisions.
5. Agile Program Development in the U.S. Navy
Several studies examined various aspects of agile project management [51–54]. For
example, Koch and Schermuly [53] suggest that agile project management practices can sig-
niﬁcantly impact organizational culture. Coram and Bohner [55,56] discussed the impact of
agile methods on software project management, arguing that agile methodologies improve
project delivery and faster adaptation to changing market requirements. Conforto et al. [57]
explored the feasibility of adopting agile project management methodologies outside the
software industry.
To ensure the development of the present framework is both impactful and delivered at
a pace that is consistent with the demands of the Navy’s GRGB program, this project focused
on developing an agile approach to project management [57]. Historically, much of the
program and project management efforts have been focused on iterative and/or incremental
approaches toward delivery. More recently, an emerging debate has arisen comparing more
traditional “heavyweight” methods with more agile and ﬂuid “lightweight” methods [58].
Heavyweight methods for project management are those that view the development process
as more linear, leading to over-reliance on processes and milestones.
Beck et al. [59] proposed the Manifesto for Agile Software Development, which empha-
sizes the ability to respond to changing market conditions, customer collaboration, and
meeting functional software requirements. The document addressed 12 universal principles
designed to deliver products to customers much more efﬁciently and to directly address
the needs and wants of the customer. The above principles are illustrated below in the
context of program management responsibilities and their use by the Navy to drive the
business analytics use case within the framework of Advana (see Table 1).
Table 1. Principles of agile software (v. 2001) development (modiﬁed after Beck et al., 2001).
Software delivery
Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of
months, with a preference for a shorter timescale. Too often, projects are
conducted in a manner where there may be an initial envisioning session.
Beyond that, developers may fail to interact with either thought leaders or
end users. This was carried out to avoid this through continuous and
transparent communication with all stakeholders.
Collaboration
Businesspeople and developers must work together daily throughout the
project. The development team must work directly with end users to better
understand their problems and how algorithms should be designed to
address those root problems.
Technologies 2023, 11, 165

Table 1. Cont.
Motivation
Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment
and support they need, and trust them to complete the job. This is carried
out to empower the development teams by giving them the opportunity to
build innovation. The teams’ creativity was perceived as a key ingredient
to ultimate success.
Communication
Face-to-face conversation continues to be the most efﬁcient and effective
method of conveying information to and within a development team.
While the demands of a distributed world were recognized, as much
face-to-face collaboration as possible was encouraged to facilitate the
sharing of ideas and more open innovation.
Demonstrations
Working software is the primary measure of progress. The goal is to share
the success via live demonstrations with the stakeholders.
Development
Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors,
developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace
indeﬁnitely. An emboldened collaborator will continue to seek ways to
improve processes.
Promotion
Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances
agility. Strong technical achievements, as often as possible, are promoted.
Simpliﬁcation
Simplicity, the art of maximizing the amount of work not completed, is
essential to the developed development approach. The teams should not
be burdened with administrative work that inhibits their ability to deliver
new and innovative product lines.
Teams
The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from
self-organizing teams. However, while collaboration across the effort is
optional, it occurs organically.
Adaptation
The team regularly reﬂects on how to become more effective, then tunes
and adjusts its behavior accordingly. In-progress reviews, ad hoc scrum
teams, and other means for self-reﬂection have been used as the key
facilitators.
5.1. Applications of Data Analytics and Machine Learning
The previous section described how the Advana Jupiter platform was harnessed
to develop a pipeline that ingests, processes, and applies quantiﬁable models to inform
analysts and program managers. This was carried out using the adoption of data mining
and machine learning approaches. More explicitly and in the context of the presented BI
use case, it was postulated that data mining and machine learning could address speciﬁc
challenges in program management within the context of the U.S. Navy by leveraging
data-driven insights to improve decision-making, optimize resource allocation, enhance
operational efﬁciency, and reduce risks.
For example, machine learning models can analyze historical program data to improve
the accuracy of cost estimates for new projects. They can help with budget planning and
allocation. Similarly, these models can conduct real-time data analysis to identify cost
overruns or anomalies, allowing program managers to promptly take corrective action.
Similarly, data mining and machine learning can assist in resource allocation decision-
making. Machine learning algorithms can allocate resources more efﬁciently by considering
project complexity, resource availability, and historical performance data. In addition, data
mining can identify potential bottlenecks or resource constraints that may impact program
timelines. Furthermore, machine learning can be used to analyze historical scheduling
data to optimize project timelines and reduce delays. These tools can also be applied to
help predict maintenance needs for Navy equipment, reducing downtime and ensuring
operational readiness.
Finally, the above tools have been utilized to assist in decision support. Speciﬁcally,
the applied data mining and machine learning models have helped support predictive
Technologies 2023, 11, 165
9 of 16
insights and allow program managers to make informed decisions about resource allocation
and risk mitigation. Similarly, data mining can be applied to simulate different program
scenarios to evaluate their potential impacts on outcomes. By leveraging data mining
and machine learning in program management, the U.S. Navy can enhance its ability to
plan, execute, and monitor programs effectively, improving mission success, cost control,
and overall operational efﬁciency. However, the extent to which these tools can inﬂuence
the discussed aspects of planning and execution depends on the quality of the iterative
feedback on model development and deployment provided by the users. Therefore, it is
critical in instances such as the use case presented here and others like it that program
managers are motivated and able to adopt a more ﬂexible framework for model acceptance
and deployment.
5.2. How the Agile Approach Impacts Program Management in the U.S. Navy
In this paper, it has been postulated that a comprehensive data pipeline inspired by
agile software development principles represents a realization of the “Get Real Get Better”
initiative. The speciﬁc instances of how agile principles can be used to emphasize iterative
development, collaboration, adaptability, and customer centricity, which can be highly
beneﬁcial in the context of Navy program management, are discussed below.
It is all too common for Navy programs to face issues such as changing requirements
and operational environments. An agile-inspired data pipeline can be designed to accom-
modate changes gracefully. They allow for quick adjustments and additions to data sources,
transformations, and analytics as program requirements evolve. Similarly, Navy program
managers are consistently challenged with high-risk decisions without the time necessary
to comprehensively weigh all options. Agile practices enable the rapid development of
data analytics and visualizations. Program managers can access up-to-date information
and quickly make informed decisions.
Program ofﬁces are also required to have continuous stakeholder collaboration. Simply
put, without effective collaboration, programs are not able to deliver on their promised
capabilities. However, agile frameworks emphasize continuous collaboration between
data teams and program managers. Frequent check-ins and feedback loops ensure that
data solutions align with program objectives. Identifying and mitigating risks is a key
program management aspect. Agile’s iterative approach allows for the continuous mon-
itoring of program data. This helps in the early detection of risk factors and adapting
strategies accordingly.
By embracing agile-inspired principles in the development and management of data
pipelines for program management, the U.S. Navy has enhanced its ability to address
dynamic challenges, make data-driven decisions, and achieve successful outcomes in a
rapidly evolving operational environment. This framework promotes a culture of adapt-
ability and continuous improvement that is well suited to the Navy’s mission requirements
and consistent with the vision that has been outlined by the “Get Better Get Real Framework”.
6. AI and Data Science in Agile Project Management
Many recently published studies have demonstrated the effective implementation of
data analytics and AI in project management [4,5]. Other studies [18,19] have discussed
the challenges of incorporating AI and data analytics into agile project management to
improve software development outcomes. Gil et al. [2] reviewed the recent approaches to
incorporating AI in project management to optimize project processes. Crawford et al. [20]
present a survey of AI applications in software engineering, speciﬁcally focusing on project
management. Most recently, Hoda et al. [60–62] introduced the concept of human-centered
AI-assisted agile project management that augments software management processes
and human decision-making. The above studies presented the beneﬁts of integrating
the principles of agile project management, AI, and data science into various project
management applications. The current paper introduces the requirements for leveraging
data analytics and AI to enhance program management in the U.S. Navy environment.

6.1. Artiﬁcial Intelligence and Machine Learning Applications
Over the past 10 years, there has been exponential growth in the use and adoption of
artiﬁcial intelligence tools, including machine learning [63]. Generally speaking, machine
learning is typically categorized into one of three different categories: supervised, unsu-
pervised, or reinforcement. Each of these approaches varies in the way it is trained, the
outputs it provides, and the application of its algorithms to various data types. In a very
general sense, artiﬁcial intelligence and machine learning represent sophisticated forms of
data analysis. Using algorithms that continuously learn from data, these approaches allow
machines to recognize hidden patterns in data sets that are often too subtle for humans
to identify and/or explain. In addition, through repeated exposure to disparate data sets
(training), machines can then extrapolate those patterns to new data to predict future states.
6.2. A Case for Deep Learning
Recent advances in computing power and architecture have allowed deep learning
algorithms to reach performance levels unmatched by other machine learning approaches.
Deep learning has been a key enabler in several key technology areas, including driverless
cars, image recognition, and human–machine interaction [12,64]. In its most basic form,
deep learning allows a computer model to perform classiﬁcation tasks directly from images,
text, or sound. Deep learning models can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, sometimes
exceeding human-level performance [65].
6.3. Generative AI
Within the past ﬁve years, there has been a resurgence of interest in the area of
generative artiﬁcial intelligence. Generative AI describes algorithms (such as ChatGPT) [66]
that can be used to create new content. In this case, content describes new material created
by the algorithm. This might include content such as audio ﬁles, programming code,
images, contract language, or videos. Recent advances in the ﬁeld of large language models
(LLMs) have dynamically changed the way artiﬁcial intelligence and its applications are
being viewed today. Generative AI opens a plethora of potential use cases within the
program management space. The primary reasoning for this is that users need not be
experts in AI and machine learning (ML) to apply these machine learning approaches.
Rather, they need to be experts in their respective domains. Indeed, a new and growing
ﬁeld in machine learning is known as “prompt engineering” [67]. Prompt engineering
is a new concept within AI and machine learning where the description of the task that
should be accomplished by the AI is embedded within the input. Rather than the algorithm
attempting to extract those features based on the training data, prompt engineering allows
the user to embed features based on the questions asked of the algorithm.
6.4. ChatGPT: Example
To demonstrate the power and ease of generative AI, a simple query using ChatGPT
has been implemented. ChatGPT is an AI chatbot developed by OpenAI. ChatGPT is built
on top of large language models (LLMs) and has been optimized using both supervised
and reinforcement learning techniques. The primary use of traditional chatbots is to model
human behavior. However, ChatGPT and this newer generation of generative AI are much
more versatile. These models have been applied in various use cases, including reading
and writing code, generating art, and other complex tasks (see Table 2).
While generative AI appears to be the most promising application of AI for program
management, caution must be exercised as well. On the one hand, using and applying LLMs
has seen exponential growth in the past half decade [68,69]. However, surrounding their
use, there has been extensive hype, misunderstanding, and misrepresentation regarding
their capabilities. For example, Bender et al. [4] pointed out that LLMs have been built on
foundational work from Natural Language Processing (NLP) [70]. However, these models
do not code for Natural Language Understanding (NLU).
Technologies 2023, 11, 165
11 of 16
Another issue with generative AI revolves around the poorly understood problem
of latent concept learning. Speciﬁcally, these models are learning relationships within the
training data that are so abstract that they are unlikely to be perceived by a human audience.
It is believed that the issues revolving around concepts such as trust and fairness [71] will
become more pronounced as these models are deployed more frequently going forward.

>>Provide Some Examples in Which Generative AI Can Be Used to Assist Program
Managers.<<
ChatGPT Reply:
Generative AI, such as GPT-3, can be used to assist in program management in a variety of ways.
Here are some examples:
1. Requirement Gathering:
Program managers can use generative AI to help with requirement gathering. They can provide
the AI with the project’s scope and goals, and the AI can generate a list of requirements that need
to be fulﬁlled to achieve those goals;
2. Risk Management:
AI can help in identifying potential risks in the program by analyzing data from past projects and
identifying patterns that indicate potential problems. This can help the program manager take
proactive measures to mitigate those risks;
3. Resource Allocation:
Program managers can use AI to assist in the allocation of resources such as personnel,
equipment, and funding. AI can help in predicting future resource needs based on past
performance data and other relevant information;
4. Schedule Optimization:
Generative AI can assist program managers in optimizing schedules by analyzing historical data
to identify the best way to sequence tasks and allocate resources;
5. Decision-Making:
AI can assist program managers in making better decisions by providing them with data-driven
insights and recommendations. This can help the program manager make informed decisions that
are more likely to lead to successful outcomes;
Overall, generative AI can help program managers streamline their processes, improve
decision-making, and increase the chances of program success. However, it is important to note
that AI should be used as a tool to assist program managers rather than a replacement for human
decision-making.
Department of Defense (DoD) program management involves complex and high-stakes projects,
and machine learning can be used to support decision-making, risk management, resource
allocation, and other aspects of program management. Here are some examples of machine
learning techniques that can be used in DoD program management:
1. Predictive analytics:
Predictive analytics can be used to forecast future outcomes and identify trends based on
historical data. This can be useful for predicting project completion dates, identifying potential
cost overruns, and estimating resource needs;
2. Natural language processing (NLP):
NLP can be used to analyze unstructured data, such as emails, chat messages, and reports. This
can help program managers identify potential risks and issues that may not be captured in
structured data;
Technologies 2023, 11, 165
12 of 16
Table 2. Cont.
3. Computer vision:
Computer vision can be used for surveillance, image analysis, and other tasks that require
processing large amounts of visual data. This can be particularly useful in the defense industry,
where there is a need for situational awareness and real-time decision-making;
4. Reinforcement learning:
Reinforcement learning can be used to optimize resource allocation and scheduling. This
approach involves using algorithms to learn from experience and improve over time based on
feedback;
5. Deep learning:
Deep learning can be used for a variety of tasks, including image and speech recognition, natural
language processing, and predictive analytics. This approach involves using neural networks to
learn from data and make predictions or decisions based on that learning.
In addition to these techniques, there are also specialized machine learning algorithms and
frameworks that have been developed speciﬁcally for defense applications, such as the Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) Explainable Artiﬁcial Intelligence (XAI) program.
Ultimately, the choice of machine learning techniques will depend on the speciﬁc needs of the
DoD program and the available data.
6.5. Implications of Generative AIs for Agile Program Management Development
Generative AI holds considerable promise for agile program management by poten-
tially enhancing creativity, automating certain tasks, and introducing rapid prototyping
capabilities. However, it also brings challenges related to quality assurance, complexity,
the need for developing new skills among program managers, and many ethical considera-
tions. As with any disruptive technology, the successful integration of generative AI into
agile program management practices in the U.S. Navy will require thoughtful planning,
continuous learning, and adaptability.
Generally, generative AI systems can create new content such as text, design concepts,
and software code [70,71]. The applications of generative AI for developing agile pro-
gram management have many theoretical and practical implications. The key theoretical
considerations include complexity and uncertainty, continuous learning and adaptation,
and redeﬁning value. Generative AI can also introduce a new level of complexity to agile
management programs due to the unpredictable and innovative nature of the generated
content. This could affect program risk assessment and the required approaches when
applying agile methodologies.
Furthermore, generative AI can constantly change its outputs based on knowledge
feedback loops when applying the agile principle of iterative development. However,
this also raises questions about achieving the successful completion of speciﬁc program
objectives and related tasks. Finally, as agile management’s traditional notion of “value”
evolves, determining the desired value of AI-generated versus human-designed system
solutions or components becomes critical to fulﬁlling the program management objectives.
The practical implications of agile program management in the U.S. Navy are sig-
niﬁcant and include (1) enhanced creativity, (2) automated task completion, (3) feedback
integration, (4) rapid prototyping, (5) skill requirements, (6) resource allocation, (7) quality
assurance and testing, and (8) ethical and governance concerns. These implications are
described in Table 3 below.

Table 3. Practical implications of generative AI for agile program management.
Enhanced creativity
Program managers can leverage generative models to
brainstorm and visualize multiple scenarios, designs, or
solutions, which can then be reﬁned based on speciﬁc
stakeholder feedback.
Automated task completion
Generative AI can automate the generation of code, reports, or
other outputs for speciﬁc repetitive or well-deﬁned tasks,
freeing program managers to focus on more complex or
creative aspects.
Feedback integration
Generative models can be retrained or ﬁne-tuned for program
management purposes based on feedback, aligning with the
agile practice of regular reﬂection and adaptation.
Rapid prototyping
The use of generative AI can quickly produce multiple
prototypes or solutions to a variety of program management
tasks, adhering to the agile principle of early and continuous
delivery.
Skill requirements
The introduction of generative AI in agile program
management will require new skill sets for program
managers, including data analytics and AI training, which
should be considered during the planning and execution
phases of the program.
Resource allocation
The use of generative AI will require additional resources,
such as high-performance computing and specialized
AI-powered software tools, which should be accounted for
during program development, planning, and execution.
Quality assurance and testing
The use of generative AI will require new testing and quality
assurance procedures to ensure the accuracy and reliability of
program management outputs.
Ethical and governance
concerns
The use of generative AI in agile program management
should be guided by ethical and governance considerations to
ensure the responsible and ethical use of these technologies.
7. Conclusions
Focusing on the tenets within the “Get Real Get Better” framework, this paper has
postulated that program managers at the U.S. Navy should leverage data-driven decision-
making to build quantitative program assessment criteria [72,73]. An approach to achieving
this has been demonstrated using a use case study implemented through the partnership
with Advana to create a machine learning pipeline for data analytics that program of-
ﬁces can harness. Addressing advanced and intelligent data analytics capabilities in the
U.S. Navy’s program management is crucial to ensuring the sustained success of national
security safeguarding [74,75]. By prioritizing data collection, labeling, and analysis, un-
locking advanced data analytics and artiﬁcial intelligence’s full potential becomes feasible,
leading to better decision-making and improved program outcomes. The time has come
for all stakeholders, ranging from program managers to top leadership, to collaborate in
cultivating a culture of organizational excellence that is data-driven and empowered by
artiﬁcial intelligence, thus fueling innovation, efﬁciency, and collaboration as the U.S. Navy
progresses toward being a more adaptable and resilient organization.

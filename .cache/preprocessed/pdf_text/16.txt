Abstract: e-Government services have evolved signiﬁcantly over the last decade, from a paper-based
bureaucratic procedure to digital services. Electronically processed transactions require limited
physical interaction with the public administration, and provide reduced response times, increased
transparency, conﬁdentiality and integrity. Blockchain technology enhances many of the above
properties as it facilitates immutability and transparency for the recorded transactions and can
help establish trust among participants. In this paper, we conduct a literature review on the use
of blockchain technology in e-government applications to identify e-government services that can
beneﬁt from the use of blockchains, types of technologies that are chosen for the proposed solutions,
and their corresponding maturity levels. The aim is to demonstrate blockchain’s potential and
contribution to the ﬁeld, provide useful insights to governments who are considering investing in
this innovative technology, and facilitate researchers in their future activities in blockchain-enabled
e-government services.

1. Introduction
Blockchain technology was initially introduced in cryptocurrency applications.
Blockchain are transparent, tamper-resistant, digital ledgers, implemented in a distributed
network of peer-to-peer nodes in which transactions are made securely and usually without
the approval of a central and trusted authority [1]. The information of every transaction is
stored hashed in blocks; each block also contains the hash of the previous block and this
chain of blocks is called the ledger. This allows a community of users to record transactions
in a shared ledger so that these transactions cannot be changed after adding it to the
blockchain. Thus, blockchains allow peer-to-peer nodes that do not have a trust relation-
ship to exchange data without third parties or intermediaries. This data could correspond
to money, contracts, land titles, medical and educational records, certiﬁcates, purchase and
sale of goods/services, or any other transactions or assets that could be digitised.
Blockchain technology, as in many other ﬁelds, has been explored by e-government to
promote public administration transformation and facilitate the provision of transparent
and secure public services. The main purpose of adopting this technological approach is to
avoid the use of a central authority for citizens’/businesses’ transactions with government
authorities, to decentralise the collection, storage and processing of data, and to ensure
data integrity and immutability.
However, the use of blockchain technology raises many privacy concerns, as many
e-government services involve personal data that needs to be properly protected so that
blockchain is not the target of adversaries gaining unauthorised access to citizens’ data.
Thus, the proposed solutions have to take into account legal restrictions, such as those
imposed by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) [2] and respect the privacy of
users when publishing transactions in the ledger, while providing the necessary authorised
access to public administration parties and other stakeholders.

Many efforts have been made by governments to adopt and implement blockchain
technology in some of their public services, although the majority of them are still at
an early stage. The aim of this paper is to provide a literature review on the use of
blockchain technologies in Government-to-Government (G2G), Government-to-Business
(G2B) and Government-to-Citizen (G2C) services in order to simplify the administrative
procedures, as well as to enhance the security, transparency and privacy of e-government
services. In this context, we explore areas such as e-contracts, e-voting, authentication, data
sharing and land registry.
The main contribution of this paper is to present a literature review with case studies
of e-government services that have adopted blockchain technology between 2015 and 2020,
description of each blockchain framework and its characteristics and the maturity level
of the proposed solutions. A two-level screening process was conducted using eligibility
criteria in an attempt to narrow down the results and gain insight into a corresponding
group of research questions regarding the use of blockchain technology in e-government
services. The results of our research provided us with a yearly distribution of the blockchain
state-of-the-art solutions that enabled us to demonstrate its potential and contribution to
the ﬁeld.
The rest of this paper is organised as follows. Section 2 provides an introduction
to blockchain technology and e-government services. The research methodology for our
literature research and analysis is presented in Section 3, while related works are provided
in Section 4. Section 5 analyses the proposed use of blockchain in e-government services,
while Section 6 discusses the ﬁndings of this research. Finally, in Section 7, we come to
our conclusions.
2. Background
2.1. Blockchain Technology
The ﬁrst appearance of blockchain technology was in October 2008 with the Bitcoin
digital currency platform by Satoshi Nakamoto [3]. Executed transactions are hashed and
stored in blocks. Each new block contains not only the stored transactions information,
but also the hash of the previous block. Figure 1 illustrates this sequence of blocks that
form a blockchain. The hash is also used to identify and integrate information. The hashing
method is a way to secure data in a blockchain [4].

Figure 1. Generic blockchain model.
The blockchain consists of a peer-to-peer network, in which transactions are executed
between nodes securely without the need for the approval of a central authority [5]. Each
node in the network is able to hold a full copy of the ledger. Each transaction is validated
through the consensus mechanism, which is the procedure of an asynchronous messaging
communication between a number of nodes in the network, such as an announcement of
a transaction representing an event in the system or the creation and broadcasting of a
block that contains information of the transaction. Afterwards, each node should validate
by checking the consistency of the transaction sequence of the new block [6]. Some of the
consensus mechanism are Proof-of-Work [7] and Proof-of-Stake [8]. Successfully validated
transactions are added to the ledger which is updated throughout the network [9].
Another way to execute transactions is with smart contracts [10] that are designed to
satisfy contractual conditions that allow the interaction between untrusted nodes and do not
require the approval of a central authority [1]. Smart contracts have become more popular
as they can be used more easily in information and communication technologies [11].

Blockchain technologies, can be divided into different types, based on requirements for
data access and control. These architectures give users the right to read and/or write data,
as well as who will participate in the consensus mechanism [12,13]. Examples are public
and private blockchains, that determine who has the right to read the existing data. Another
categorisation is the permissionless and permissioned blockchain, which determine the
ability to add blocks to the chain and participate in the consensus mechanism [14,15].
2.2. e-Government Services
e-Government is an effort by governments to use Information and Communications
Technology (ICT) to automate public services and facilitate their use by citizens (G2C),
businesses (G2B) and intergovernmental (G2G), such as secure data transfer, e-procurement,
ﬁlling tax returns, identity management, electronic voting, etc. The purpose of this effort is
to integrate public services electronically, in which the service of citizens and businesses to
be done safely, transparently and with trust in a decentralised way without the involvement
of public authorities and to eliminate bureaucracy.
Due to the increasing demand for online services from citizens and the need for
reducing bureaucracy, more and more governments are turning their services to electronic
forms. Electronic services are all time available and accessible from everywhere, and easy
to use. The European Commission, recognizing the demands of citizens, businesses
and governments for having access to e-government services, has been working on an
e-government action plan. This action plan has based on the e-government benchmark
for the period 2016–2020, which collects data on an annual basis from online stakeholders
for new proposals for the future action plan [16] The action plan envisages user-friendly
public administrations to reduce administrative burdens through digital services, cross-
border services through connecting public administrations across Europe, opening up
government data, services and procedures to create better or new services and improve
policies. Four principles deﬁne the action plan: digital-by-default, cross-border by default,
once-only principle and inclusive by default. Furthermore, the e-government benchmark
measures progress in four areas, called top-level benchmarks: user-centricity, transparency,
key enablers and cross-border mobility [17]. For user-centricity as technology evolves,
upcoming technologies such as blockchain, augmented and virtual reality, and AI, are
expected to be part of the digital services improvement [18].
Many researches were made in which ways blockchain will beneﬁt as an infrastructure
in e-government services, and the challenges that this approach can have [13].
3. Research Methodology
The research methodology that has been followed in this review paper included
an initial search on Scopus (www.scopus.com, accessed on 15 January 2021) to identify
published works related to the use of blockchain technology in e-government services.
The search query that was used for this purpose, looking at the title, abstract and keywords
of the papers, is as follows:
TITLE-ABS-KEY(("e-governance" OR "smart governance" OR "smart government"
OR "e-government") AND (blockchain OR "distributed ledger"))
Our search was conducted in January 2021, and included 131 results until the end of
2020. We have worked on a two-level screening process, as shown in Figure 2. Therefore,
we set the following eligibility criteria: the paper, (i) presents a solution that uses blockchain
technology exclusively in e-government services, (ii) is published in peer-reviewed journals
or conferences, (iii) is written in English and (iv) has the full-text available. On the ﬁrst
level, we have looked at the title, abstract and keywords of the papers and excluded those
papers that did not meet our eligibility criteria. From this process, we excluded 84 papers
and the remaining papers were 47. On the second level of the screening process, we have
looked at the full-text of the papers taking into consideration the same eligibility criteria
and the results were 19 papers.

4. Related Work
In this section, we present previous literature reviews on the use of blockchain technol-
ogy in e-government services. During our research, three literature reviews were identiﬁed
and included publications up to the year 2018.
Franciscon et al. [15] focused on a systematic review of the types of software architec-
ture used in public services based on blockchain technology. However, several publications
have not articulately described their architecture. Their research was conducted for publi-
cations made in the years from 2016 to 2018.
Batubara et al. [19] researched the state of the art solutions and addressed the chal-
lenges faced by the adoption of blockchain technology in e-government services. Their
analysis mainly included system architecture, conceptual frameworks, system analysis,
design, development and evaluation and was limited to publications that use blockchain

technology exclusively in e-government services. The systematic literature review was
conducted for publications made until the end of 2017.
Alexopoulos et al. [20] ﬁrst started by conducting a literature review in general on
the types and features of blockchain technology to gather the beneﬁts and obstacles of
this technology, then they researched for projects that used blockchain technology in e-
government services, and, ﬁnally, they conducted semi-structured interviews with experts
to validate their ﬁndings. Their research was performed for publications made until the
year 2018.
In this paper, we have included publications until the end of 2020, as shown in
Section 3. Additionally, we have focused on the implementations of the proposed solutions,
the utilised blockchain technology and its characteristics, and the maturity level of the
given solutions.
5. Blockchain-Enabled e-Government Applications
In this section, we have categorised the papers that remained from the screening
process, by the type of e-government services they have provided or supported, and we
present each of these solutions based on this categorisation. The categorisation is also
shown in Table 1 accompanied by the answers to the research questions given in Section 3.

5.1. Authentication
Chen et al. [21] proposed a blockchain-based trust-transferring scheme using different
PKI systems to enhance trust when users need cross-domain access. They have worked
to solve at a national level the trust service problem of PKI using blockchain consensus.
The authors have proposed a consortium blockchain, which includes users of a particular
group and a limited number of regulatory parties. Some of the nodes can be named to
mutually maintain the ledger and block generation. Alternative PKI systems services
participating in the consortium can be used by users. When a user wants to have access to
a service, she needs to be validated by presenting her certiﬁcate. An authentication request
is sent to the blockchain for the presented certiﬁcate to validate whether the certiﬁcate is
active or revoked. As a security enhancement, the blockchain scheme uses the traditional
Online Certiﬁcate Status Protocol (OCSP) [40,41], which returns the status of the certiﬁcate
to the blockchain in real-time. Following that, the blockchain sends for each certiﬁcate its
information and time to the server. The ﬁnal step is for the server to conﬁrm the information
and pass the veriﬁcation.
Khan et al. [22] suggested that full integration of e-business services and e-government
services could be achieved by using blockchain technologies. This could make the govern-
ment’s processes faster and more secure. Also, data synchronisation between departments
could easily be achieved. In their paper, they explore the evolution of e-government
services in the U.A.E. and speciﬁc in one of the government’s departments in Dubai.
A consortium blockchain technology was adopted for developing a Uniﬁed Corporate
Registry which will allow authenticated users to create and update license information
though the blockchain. For this implementation the Hyperledger Fabric platform was
used. The registry is integrated with other nodes in the network such as public registries,
and other business entities. Each node pushes to the corresponding business activity entity
the license information whenever there is an new issue or renewal or modiﬁcation or
cancellation. There are three types of members in the united registry, the nodes that publish
data to the registry, the data subscribers and the service providers, the nodes that subscribe
data from the registry for any business activity transaction, and the nodes that manage
registry’s indexes.
Batubara et al. [23] evidenced the existence of improvement in transparency and
accountability in e-government services when using blockchain technologies. As a case
study for their work, they used the land registry and how blockchain technology could
improve transparency and accountability. The use of cryptographic pair of keys is not
enough. The user’s authentication needs supreme perquisites for the system to function
properly, enforcing an electronic identity prerequisite on all members of the blockchain.
If members want to validate only users that have conﬁrmed their real identity to the
relevant authority that manages their transaction, then a public permissioned blockchain
is adequate. Therefore, the electronic identity is needed. By this, the legal status of all
members that transact is guaranteed and at the same time the transparency is preserved
since the information on the ledger is public and everyone can read it. In case of land
registry, the smart contract could be utilised as support of the system. Speciﬁc rules
and prerequisites could be enclosed into the smart contract; the results are added to the
blockchain. Each block of the chain is being transmitted to the network in order for the
nodes to validate it. After the block is validated it will be appended to the previous block
of the ledger. The authentication is made by using asymmetric cryptography that means
that the speciﬁc member is authorised to work on it. In addition, by the presence of a large
number of nodes and by the consensus algorithm in the communication between all nodes
for the validation of the transaction, the whole network accepts the transactions.
Pinter et al. [24] suggested that e-government services, such as e-ID, could be en-
hanced by using blockchain technology. The main concept is to avoid a centralised model
where only one authority could authenticate users. A decentralised model also helps to
enhance security layers against attacks. Another matter that needs to be considered, is data
protection because data is stored publicly on the blockchain. An approach to avoid data
Computers 2021, 10, 168
7 of 17
protection breaches is to store only technical references to the blockchain, all the other data
could be stored locally. In the privacy-by-design framework, multiple identities should
allow if needed for each user. Using blockchain helps to conﬁrm the user’s identities by
the signature of their public keys. Their proposed architecture is based on the SVN-G
draft law. For the identiﬁcation of users. The user has to log on to an ID portal, where he
can choose one of the authorised Know Your Customer (KYC) [42] providers, to identify
himself. When the KYC completes the veriﬁcation of the user’s identity, the information
is stored in the public blockchain. After that, the user is provided with a signature from
the KYC which helps him to log on without revealing his personal data in any service
that trusts the KYC provider. The connection between a public key and other ofﬂine data
such as ID number is stored with the KYC provider in a private database. In case of illegal
activities, the corresponding information is provided to the authorities. The advantage
of using the blockchain in the process of the KYC provider helps to protect against the
DoS attacks.
Páez et al. [25] proposed a blockchain-based architecture and a new consensus algo-
rithm for digital identiﬁcation of citizens by using biometric information. The proposed
Colombian national e-ID system uses a blockchain to manage citizens’ transactions, where
users are authenticated and their transactions are validated using ﬁngerprint and iris
recognition. The blockchain network architecture uses a private, permissioned blockchain
where only notaries and registries can be part of it. Two types of nodes can be part of
the network. One of these two are in charge of issuing an identity document when it is
requested by the citizens and they are located in the registration ofﬁces. These nodes are the
only ones that can generate any digital certiﬁcate with its public and private keys by using
each citizen’s personal identiﬁcation number. After the above-mentioned procedure is
ﬁnished and the digital certiﬁcate is issued, the citizen can digitally sign any document and
perform any transaction. Notary ofﬁces are the other type of nodes, which are responsible
for maintaining citizen’s civil status, validating the correspondence of citizen’s identity and
the relevant document for citizen’s proof of identity. When a new node wants to participate
to the network, it sends a request to every node in the network. If it is conﬁrmed as an
authorised node, it receives a copy of the ledger and has the right to create a transaction
and add blocks to the chain. The network uses the Tournament Consensus Algorithm
(TCA) in order to choose which node will add the next block to the chain. TCA sends
a request for choosing a number between 0 and 1 to everyone who is connected to the
network every random time. The node that has collected all random numbers, ﬁnds the
bigger number and sends back to the node who sent it a winner’s vote. The node that
collects the majority of the votes will be the one that has the right to add the next block.
In order to avoid the loss of time and energy for mining the block, the Proof-of-Luck (PoL)
characteristics [43] were used to allow anyone to solve it quickly unlike the Proof-of-Work
(PoW) [44].
5.2. Data Sharing
Liu et al. [26] proposed a data-sharing framework that focuses on data protection
breaches when sharing data between different government departments and they describe
how to protect data breaches during the transaction. Sharing information between nodes is
made using private blockchains, this authenticates the nodes on the network and enables
them to trust each other. At the same time, it establishes the data’s fundamental features
and decreases the data framework disorder. The system could also query the data according
to the criteria, collects the names of departments that possess the data and exchange the
request. The blockchain also sort the aggregated user message and process user data
anonymously to ensure anonymity. The data in the blockchain-based privacy framework
includes three layers: (1) the database layer, which the primary database that contains the
raw data and the privacy database the privacy processed data, (2) the server layer, which
processes the data, and (3) the blockchain layer, which stores each node’s data directories
and the node that possesses the data. After the completion of the procedure, the data
Computers 2021, 10, 168
8 of 17
directory will expand and recorded on the blockchain, which they believe it is difﬁcult to
have data protection breach. When there is a data request, the ﬁrst step, is to locate the
requested information and sends the request to the node. When the request is accepted,
a speciﬁc process runs to store the requested data to the privacy server, then the request
is conﬁrmed and the data sharing starts. The role of the blockchain is to authenticate
each user and prevent the counterfeit of the data. The validation is made using the PoW
consensus algorithm.
Ghanem and Alsouﬁ[27] have used as a case study an e-service provided by the
e-government portal through the creation of an interoperable network between involved
organisations in the transaction. Their framework facilitates information exchange in G2C,
G2B and C2C services and improves their collaboration. The e-government portal provides
citizens with an e-Key which is used for requesting services securely and authenticate them.
It is the citizens’ obligation to maintain their e-Keys. The role of the blockchain is to specify
the proper smart contract which is associated with the corresponding service to check for
the necessary documentation to complete the requested service. The collection process
has to be validated by the citizen. After the essential documents are completed, the smart
contract empowers the relevant service provider to collect a copy of the documents in order
to complete the operation deﬁned by the smart contract. Once a new document is issued,
it is added to the blockchain where all parties of the network need to validate it by the
mining process. The initial document will be reserved on the service provider’s storage
for availability and authenticity for the granted user. Even though all users keep a copy of
the ledger they can only preview the document in order to complete the service. On the
other hand, citizens will have access to the documents anytime and anywhere since the
service is provided on the web and mobile devices. The control of allowing joining nodes
for the mining process is made by using a consortium blockchain. For the implementation,
an existing platform is considered such as Ethereum or the e-government’s network.
Zhang et al. [28] have considered blockchain as the fundamental technology to create
a government model for sharing information among different government departments,
including ﬁscal, legal, tax, educational and medical departments, and solve security and
reliability problems. The authors set out the implementation strategy based on a consortium
blockchain and providing solutions for government information sharing. Blockchain
technology is based on a peer-to-peer network, where the content of the nodes is immutable,
while using a consensus plugin guarantees the synchronisation of the data, and also ensures
the safety of data. The network accomplishes the data synchronisation of the nodes with
protocols such as Proof-of-Stake (PoS) or Proof-of-Work (PoW). Information routing is
accomplished through consensus and smart contracts. All data sharing information is
hashed inside the sharing platform. The blockchain will verify the ciphertext data, while
reading the stored information in order to reduce the instability of the node by storing the
reading records in order to trace errors when self-audit. Their framework of information
exchange uses a three-level software architecture that connects the data and presentation
layer through a blockchain-based layer. The data layer contains information stored in
a blockchain, such as information exchange using Internet and Internet-of-Things (IoT)
devices. The blockchain-based layer scattered storage, smart contracts, consensus algorithm
and others combining the data and presentation layer. Finally, the presentation layer is the
interface of government service application.
Xu et al. [29] proposed a trusted and ﬂexible Electronic Certiﬁcate Catalog Sharing
(ECCS) system which is the ﬁrst analysis solution about electronic certiﬁcate register shar-
ing services that differ from other existing discoveries. ECCS segregates the network into a
channel where each channel represents authorised participants to access data for the smart
contract that have been deployed to the channel. Their scheme designs and simulates a pio-
neer blockchain system based on a three-level electronic certiﬁcate architecture. Therefore,
the electronic certiﬁcate register sharing system is based on a consortium blockchain that
uses smart contracts to record and review every usage of electronic certiﬁcate automatically
and independently. Therefore, transactions about catalogue sharing or request of electronic
Computers 2021, 10, 168
9 of 17
certiﬁcates are kept private from other entities which have not joined the channel. In other
words, those entities authorised by the ROOT-CA node or intermediate CA node has
permission to access the ledger. All Ledger data on each peer is encrypted via ﬁle system
encryption to achieve the privacy of data related to electronic certiﬁcates. Moreover, data
that are transmitted among peer nodes, ordering nodes and CA nodes are encrypted via
TLS (Transport Layer Security). ECCS builds an access control pattern in the smart contract
to restrict data access to certain roles which can meet the requirements for e-government
service. Whoever, electronic certiﬁcates or catalogue sharing service requests will be added
successfully to the blockchain without any human interference. This can provide trusted
audit and trace when a dispute occurs. The blockchain-based system is a universal solution
for the shared service of the digital certiﬁcate. That is to say, entities that want to cooperate
on certain business but do not trust each other can use the blockchain-based system to
achieve sharing services of data. The implementation was made by using the Hyperledger
Fabric to demonstrate the functionality and practicality. The preliminary results showed
that the work and functionality could meet all prerequisites of e-government.
Naing [30] proposed a generic model of an open blockchain framework that could
be used for all types of e-government services, Government to Employee, Government to
Citizens, Business to Business and Government to Government to ensure security, reliabil-
ity and robustness of the e-government services. The use of a common data framework
between all the authorities will also increase interoperability. Previous form the implemen-
tation, e-government strategies were reviewed from several other countries in Asia, East
Asia and the EU. The proposed generic framework is based on a distributed blockchain
with ﬁve layers: (1) Development Platform for e-gov services Layer, which includes front-
end services and UI, application and data templates. (2) Blockchain Technology Service
Layer, this layer is the most important because it includes services such as smart contracts,
cryptocurrency, consensus algorithms such as Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Authority
(PoA), Cybersecurity and many other services. (3) Data Standardisation and Distribution
Layer, in this layer various data from different ministries or authorities are stored. (4) Data
Storage Service Layer, this layer supports data centres services. (5) Secure and Distributed
Infrastructure Layer, which supports secure communication for the blockchain network.
Elisa et al. [31] proposed a secure and decentralised e-government consortium
blockchain-based system that transforms the traditional paper-based data sharing govern-
ment system to its electronic counterpart that provides services in a friendly environment
for citizens and businesses despite their physical location, also to provide convenience,
transparency and efﬁciency and at the same time to improve quality of the e-gov services.
The proposed consortium blockchain-based system architecture it consists of four layers,
the services access layer, the consortium blockchain layer, the network layer and the ledger
storage layer. The services access layer is composed of e-government users and different
devices to provide access, and storage of user’s credentials. The consortium blockchain
layer is a peer-to-peer network of pre-selected e-government nodes for validating trans-
actions and to authenticate users before joining the network. The consortium blockchain
layer is also responsible for the communication between nodes, user management and the
consensus. The Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm is used on this network. The network
layer provides the connection between all layers. The ledger storage layer is used to store
out of the blockchain large ﬁles such as documents, images or data that is going to be
deleted or amended in the future. The necessity of this layer is due to the immutability of
the blockchain.
5.3. e-Voting
Hjalmarsson et al. [32] have implemented an e-voting system that uses a permissioned
blockchain. To achieve their goals for privacy and security, they have used a Go-Ethereum
private Proof-of-Authority (PoA) blockchain. The consensus mechanism is based on the
identity as a stake, which helps to deliver transactions faster. Their implementation consists
of two types of nodes: District nodes and Bootnote. The ﬁrst type of node represents the
Computers 2021, 10, 168
10 of 17
voting restricts which manages the smart contracts for the voting and the second type of
node represents the institutions with private access to the network, this type of node works
as a service that helps the district nodes to communicate with each other. Each voter has his
identity wallet for each election he/she participates in. For the election, the administrator
of the elections creates a ballot smart contract for each corresponding district node, then
the voter can start to vote, after the voter places his/her vote the data of the vote is veriﬁed
by the bulk of the district nodes and the vote is added to the blockchain. For each voting,
the voter receives a voting ID which can be used to verify that his/her vote is listed on
the blockchain and counted correctly. The voting transaction on the blockchain does not
contain any of the voter’s data to maintain the privacy requirements. The authors tested
their blockchain-based voting system in different blockchain frameworks such as Exonum,
Quorum and Go-Ethereum, to decide which implementation was the best solution.
Yavuz et al. [33] have implemented a small scale e-voting system using a private
Ethereum blockchain platform, speciﬁcally the Rinkeby network for a secure e-voting
system that does not allow duplicate votes and it is completely transparent and at the
same time protects the voter’s identity. The Ethereum blockchain network was suitable
for them because all transactions are made in real-time. As an exchange for adding blocks
into the ledger, Ethers, Ethereum’s digital currency is given to miners for their work
of validating and adding blocks to the ledger. The consensus is made using the PoW
algorithm. They have used smart contracts to verify and calculate the votes which are
written in the solidity programming language, the contracts are run by the nodes every
15 s, and their activation must have at least 2 validations from other nodes. Also, in the
voting procedure, Ethereum accounts can be used for the elections which helps not to
reveal the voter’s identity because it uses hashed values, but this is not enough for personal
authentication of voters, it needs additional ways such as multi-factor authentication
methods because account authentication is not enough. For a person to vote using his/her
Ethereum wallet has to have also a small number of Ethers, to cast a vote. In their paper,
they have excluded individual authentication and legal regulations because are considered
different sub-cases. As we have mentioned above, their implementation is limited for
small scale voting systems, which means, in a larger-scale voting system may appear
different problems.
Khan et al. [34] described the evolution of their primary proposed idea published
in 2018 for a secure e-voting system [45]. Their proposed e-voting system was deployed
using an open-source Multi-chain Blockchain and its version Alpha 4. They selected this
speciﬁc version because it has new features which helped them to handle a stream of
data along with voting. To investigate the impact on the transaction processing time,
size, average and maximum number of processed transactions and average block size,
they have experimented with three different voting implementation scenarios based on
different settings such as how many voters will participate, candidates and if clients will
be local or remote. For the ﬁrst two cases, they used a permissionless blockchain having
voters with the ability to mine. The third case is acting for a public voting model, where
a permissioned blockchain was used with speciﬁed nodes for the mining and validating
procedure. Before the voting starts, the voters have to be registered as unique hashes,
this procedure helps to maintain voter’s privacy. These hashes will be used by voters to
transfer their vote. The voter, have the right to receive from the relevant authority a voting
token which will use to cast the vote to his favourite candidate to prevent duplicate voting.
The votes are stored in the private blockchain as an asset and also stored to an address that
works as an authority that transfers votes to the candidates. The validation for the casted
votes is succeeded by using the PoW consensus algorithm. The consensus is succeeded
from a pool of trusted user that work as miners and they are responsible for accepting or
not the voting transaction, if a voting transaction is accepted, then it is being added as a
block to the ledger.

5.4. Land Property Services
Alketbi et al. [35] have researched and analysed real estate in Dubai as a case study
by identifying the involved entities, exploring the real estate process running in Dubai
and also identifying the challenges, the impact of using blockchain technology on the real
estate market. In this research, they have used a permissioned blockchain structure for
enhancing the transparency of the transactions, minimising the cost and making easier
the processes of real estate. During their research, they have based on the Hyperledger
Fabric platform and its smart contacts. Since selling or renting land properties includes
multiple participants, the main objectives for using blockchain technology in real estate is
the automation of the property cycle by using smart contracts, management of digital assets
by using tokens for properties and real estate in real-time by having predeﬁned policies
for instant settlement of transactions. The main roles of participants in the blockchain
network are the network administrator, who conﬁgures the network policies and installs
the consensus services, the operator node, who is responsible for monitoring and managing
consensus in cluster nodes, the architect node, who is responsible for the blockchain
architecture, and policies deﬁnition, the blockchain administrator node, who is different
from the above-mentioned network administrator and it is responsible for administering
nodes and their operations, including smart contract installation, and last the developer
node, who is responsible for developing applications. Each node in the blockchain can
participate in one or more permissioned networks. The blockchain smart contracts run
through applications and after succeeded transactions, the ledgers are updated. For the
future, they proposed the application of blockchain with an alternative operating model to
other governments for improvements.
Nguyen et al. [36] have experimented and evaluated the use of blockchain for issuing
land valuation certiﬁcates. They have deﬁned a generic blockchain model for managing
procedure integrated with the e-government services framework. Before starting the
implementation, they explored the current procedures of issuing land valuation certiﬁcates
and due to the Vietnamese network security law, all datacenters must be settled inside
Vietnam, so any permissionless blockchain network would not be proper. Therefore,
for their implementation, they have chosen to use Hyperledger Fabric, by setting up
a private blockchain network, even though the network is private the land valuation
certiﬁcates are accessible from a public endpoint of the network. They ended up using
Hyperledger Fabric because it is an open source blockchain platform, it can support large
consortium and by comparing with other platforms, it has more stable releases. For the
data storage they used the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) [46] and a scalable database
for string big data BigChainDB [47]. This implementation is an extension of the main
current service for the e-government framework. The land valuation platform includes
the following services: identiﬁcation of users who can interact with the stored data, these
are authenticated and authorised by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment
to sign the digital certiﬁcates. Data mapping, this service is responsible to map different
types of data into a key-value form. Smart contracts deployment and installation for every
type of transaction. Consensus, for the initial state it includes the packing procedure of
transactions into blocks before adding them to the ledger, in the future this may change
according to new requirements. Monitoring of system health, application operations,
system availability and anything else that will prevent any failure of the blockchain.
Deployment and conﬁguration of tools for peers. This experiment implementation meets
the requirements of current service procedures for issuing land valuation certiﬁcates and
also helps to digitise at the same time similar procedures.
5.5. e-Delivery Services
Payeras-Capella et al. [37] have presented two different schemes of an e-Delivery
service to reduce the participation of third trusted parties in comparison with the up until
now approaches without excluding the EU guidelines for e-Delivery systems. The schemes
were based on a private and public e-Delivery system using blockchain and smart contracts
Computers 2021, 10, 168
12 of 17
to deliver fair exchanges and reduce the role of Trusted Third Parties. Both schemes follow
a three-step exchange: at the beginning, the sender sends an encoded message to a group
of receivers, following, the receivers have to accept or reject the message, at the ﬁnal step,
the sender completes the transaction by providing the message and the proof of acceptance
from the receivers. The main difference between these two schemes is that on the private
approach the communication exchange is made off-chain regarding the public solution
that the communication exchange is made on-chain. For the implementation of the two
schemes, they have used the Ethereum blockchain and its cryptocurrency for the execution
of the communication. To maintain security and privacy during the implementation they
have used digital signatures, symmetric and public key encryption, key wrapping and
hash functions. Both schemes are available on GitHub (https://github.com/secomuib,
accessed on 28 April 2021).
5.6. Human Resources Management
Neiheiser et al. [38] presented an architecture which can be applicable to any blockchain
network that uses smart contracts. More precisely, they present an Human Resources Man-
agement (HRM) system, where its decentralised process assure transparency and protect
both members from malevolent actions. The model includes three types of users which can
be veriﬁed by their public key: The applicant, the reviewer and the institution. Two types
of smart contracts are available in the system, the one with a list of all institutions and
the other which keeps the job’s position information and its status. When an opened job
position is published, it creates a smart contract on the blockchain. This helps applicants to
see more information for each job position. When applicants are registered they receive
information about the progress of the process. There is a list of professional reviewers that
the smart contract selects one of them to review the job application. For a new institution
to be added as a member of the network, a signiﬁcant number of accepts is required. To
sustain the privacy of the applicants, construction of a semi-permissioned model connected
with a permissionless blockchain is used. When an institution opens a job position, it
creates and publishes a smart contract to the blockchain. The job position is now available
to the applicants to register, after the deadline is reached the job position is no longer
available to the applicants, then a reviewer is elected to evaluate the application and to
post the results. For the validation of the transactions a Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus
algorithm is used.
5.7. Government Contracting
Diallo et al. [39] proposed the blockchain-based system that allows real-time monitor-
ing analysis of the e-government services and can be apply to any policy for government
contracting. This system offers transparency, accountability and better service management.
They introduced a generic blockchain framework for applying any policy of government
contracting and they consider as a case study the US Small business Administration pol-
icy [48]. The blockchain-based system executes all the transaction and publishes the results
to the public. They have used a public blockchain network. There are four categories of
steps for contracts, preparation and submission, bidding and selection, execution moni-
toring and auditing. In the beginning, the system validates that a contract is submitted,
after the validation is completed the transaction is added to the blockchain, after that
comes the bidding step, the validation of the transaction is made using the PoW consensus
algorithm. To become a user of the blockchain-based system, the entity must register. When
the registration is completed a certiﬁcate is issued by the authority as an identity for the
system, the certiﬁcate is a pair of keys, a private and a public key which is rooted in a
digital certiﬁcate. For enhancing transparency, the guidelines of how to use and manage
the certiﬁcate are rooted in a smart contract. All traditional contracts are transformed into
smart contracts and translated into the supported language of the system. The generated
contract is digitally signed by the issuing authority and shares with the other members of
the system’s network. The member of the system’s network checks if the issued contract is
Computers 2021, 10, 168
13 of 17
regulated and digitally signed using the pair of keys. If everything is conﬁrmed, the con-
tract is available to the public, and the offering procedure starts. All interesting parties can
prepare a signed proposal and submit it to the system. Each submitted offer is checked by
the parties and those offers that satisfy the regulations will be accepted and written to the
blockchain. The winning bidder is the one that its offer meets the regulations, at the whole
procedure the winner is kept secret until the bidder proceeds to the next step. The ﬁnal
selection’s block is added to the blockchain. In the case of public blockchain security issues
are raised since the stored data is publicly available, to reduce this concern, all parties in
the system network could negotiate to encrypt and protect the sensitive data, but this could
lead to the reduction of the government’s transparency.
6. Discussion
Initially, the use of the blockchain was limited to ﬁnancial transactions using cryptocur-
rencies. Over the years, blockchain features such as transparency, data security in which
data amendments are not applicable when they added in the blockchain [49] and also its
decentralised network, have attracted the interest of many researchers to adopt blockchain
technology in various other areas besides ﬁnancial transactions. One of these areas is
e-governance for better and secure services for citizens, businesses and governments.
We have seen that from 2018 and onward (see Figure 3) the number of papers is
increasing signiﬁcantly. The majority of the proposed blockchain solutions are at an early
stage, as a small percentage of them (see Figure 4) have reached the stage of system
evaluation or even prototype implementation.

The bulk of the ﬁndings in the conducted review for this paper are related to authenti-
cation, data sharing and e-voting services whereas, less of the ﬁndings are related to other
e-government services. Also, only 4 of the proposed solutions (21%) were implemented
as prototypes and on average the maturity of all solutions was between conceptual and
experimental level (2.89) (more details in Figure 5).
Our ﬁndings show that blockchain as a novice technology in e-government services
needs more research for improvement. Most of the studies and their corresponding
implementations mainly focuses on security issues as opposed to privacy preservation
which needs to be further studied, taking into account the GDPR and the limitations
of public data. However, other issues that have to consider when adopting blockchain
technology in e-gov services are the integration with other technologies. Such as data
storage for reserving ﬁles (i.e., certiﬁcates and other public documents).

We believe that in the upcoming years there will be an increase in research into e-
government services using blockchain technology, as improvements are made to existing
blockchain platforms or new ones are developed. The transactions are executed using the
minimum computing resources through smart contracts, in contrast to other consensus
mechanisms. As a future direction, we believe that it would be useful to create a uniﬁed
architecture of a blockchain network in which services can be easily integrated without
limiting the number of services provided on the network. To this end, the European Union
has already stepped up its efforts to digitally transform the public sector [50] by building a
pan-European public service blockchain for creating trust in data, allowing citizens and
organizations to trust each other to collectively agree without a third-party authority. This
effort includes environmental sustainability, data protection, digital identity, cybersecurity
and interoperability.
Our main goal is to do a literature review and capture the state-of-art of the use of
blockchain technology in e-government services for scientiﬁc journals, conference, etc.
However, we have not included whitepapers, grey literature, reports, etc., and it is clear
that not all of the solutions are being recorded in our work and there might be more
available solutions already implemented and in production that are not published in a
scientiﬁc journal or conference proceedings, such as the projects of the European Blockchain
Service Infrastructure (EBSI). The European Union Member States and the European Union
Commission have joined forces and formed the European Blockchain Partnership (EBP)
and built the EBSI for the creation of cross-border services for public administrations, to
verify information and make services trustworthy using blockchain.
7. Conclusions
With the expansion of blockchain technology in areas other than cryptocurrencies,
the research efforts have been radically expanding during the past years. Blockchain
technology is considered as a revolutionary approach in the area of public services and
e-governance, and acts as an enabler for citizens, businesses and governments to easily
interact with each other in a transparent way. Its innovation comes from the combination
of transparency, integrity, conﬁdentiality and accountability, when accurately designed.
Moreover, a distributed blockchain network enhances trust among all participants, as trans-
actions are executed securely without the approval of a central authority.
In this paper, we have conducted a two-level screening process using eligibility criteria
to narrow down the results and gain insight into our research questions regarding the use
of blockchain in e-government services. Having presented the ﬁndings of our research,
we have recorded the maturity level of the solutions using blockchain technology in e-
government services. The results of our research have been grouped chronologically
Computers 2021, 10, 168
15 of 17
according to the type of service, comprising details regarding the blockchain characteristics,
the maturity level of the solution and the case study.
Blockchain as a disruptive technology has the potential to signiﬁcantly contribute
towards more robust and transparent e-government services. Research activities in the ﬁeld
have to be intensiﬁed and more results have to be produced to draw safe conclusions with
regards to the most viable and sustainable blockchain-enabled e-government services.

Abstract: The process of generating, disseminating, using, and managing an organization’s informa-
tion and knowledge is known as knowledge management (KM). Conventional KM has undergone
modiﬁcations throughout the years, but documentation has always been its foundation. However,
the signiﬁcant move to remote and hybrid working has highlighted the shortcomings in current
procedures. These gaps will be ﬁlled by artiﬁcial intelligence (AI), which will also alter how KM is
transformed and knowledge is handled. This article analyzes studies from 2012 to 2022 that examined
AI and KM, with a particular emphasis on how AI may support businesses in their attempts to suc-
cessfully manage knowledge and information. This critical review examines the current approaches
in light of the literature that is currently accessible on AI and KM, focusing on articles that address
practical applications and the research background. Furthermore, this review provides insight into
potential future study directions and improvements by presenting a critical evaluation.
Keywords: artiﬁcial intelligence; knowledge management; knowledge-based system; knowledge
acquisition; machine learning
1. Introduction
Through the emergence of digital documents, which are attributed to the development
of knowledge management (KM) systems, the 20th century saw a major revolution in the
administration of information [1,2]. Economic trends in the twenty-ﬁrst century emphasize
the value that KM can provide to businesses. The importance of knowledge and information
for economic prosperity has been acknowledged around the globe [3].
Knowledge management is a novel method for locating and arranging specialized
knowledge for efﬁcient retrieval and re-use [4]. By managing knowledge both internally
and externally, with diverse stakeholders, the intention behind KM is to provide value
to companies. Organizations understand the value of knowledge and how to transition
from individual to corporate knowledge to ensure their companies thrive sustainably [5].
Information technology, organizational behavior, and human-resource management are
just a few of the principles that are combined in KM. Modern businesses need KM because
it fosters institutional learning, growth, innovation, and success [6]. Knowledge-based
businesses in the market have proven to be more resilient and competitive [7].
Artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) has become a cornerstone of KM in the twenty-ﬁrst century
because it has advanced information acquisition, development, and sharing, as well as
its effective application inside businesses [8,9]. Numerous studies were carried out to
investigate the most recent advancements in KM systems, methods, and best practices, as
well as their effects on businesses [9–11]. Furthermore, KM techniques have shown their
value in the adoption of instructional technology [12,13]. Various methods, including deep
learning, neural networks, and supervised machine learning, are used by AI technologies
to replicate human intelligence. The most efﬁcient deep-learning algorithms frequently

use a supervised approach, in which enormous amounts of labeled data are used to train
the strengths of connections between nodes in massive, layered computational networks,
allowing patterns in training data to be employed to produce accurate predictions on future
unseen data [14].
It is crucial at this point to explore how the relationship between AI and KM can
be used to harness AI more effectively as we move toward a future driven by data and
insight. Before determining the link between KM and AI, it is essential to understand
how organizations apply knowledge [15]. Organizations have a variety of responsibilities,
the meeting and competitiveness of which depend on employees’ level of expertise in
carrying out crucial duties and their standing in the business [16]. Many KM practitioners
and theorists neglect AI as one of the crucial building blocks in the growth, improvement,
progression, and expansion of KM [17]. As a ﬁeld of study, AI was established before KM,
has been based and balanced in the computer ﬁeld for decades, and is widely deployed
across many ﬁelds [18].
AI and machine learning, including the study of organizational and industrial net-
works, are proven to be indispensable commercial tools [19,20]. Knowledge management
appears to have advanced during the twenty-ﬁrst century [21]. Furthermore, AI and
blockchain have revolutionized how information is gathered, created, shared, and utilized
efﬁciently inside enterprises [22,23]. The ability to run centralized big-data-processing
platforms is essential for emerging AI applications, since they manage huge volumes of
data streams. The applications offer customized knowledge patterns for certain sets of
systems, devices, applications, and people. Centralized KM and knowledge discovery
support the provision of system- and application-wide intelligence [24]. The ability of AI
to identify contexts, ideas, and meaning are emphasized, along with the emergence of
intriguing new cooperation routes between knowledge machines and workers.
This study attempts to integrate the literature on AI with that on KM and focuses
primarily on establishing the degree to which AI may generate innovations for effective
information and KM. There is an urgent need for academics to offer an overview of the
AI-based methodologies that are currently in use in order to comprehend the complexity
of this rapidly developing study ﬁeld. This study addresses these urgent concerns by
describing the following conditions:

Future research directions
This critical review examines the present state of knowledge in light of the available
literature on AI and KM, with an emphasis on papers that address practical applications
and the background of the study. This review conducts a critical examination to give
insights into prospective future research paths and improvements.
2. Background of the Study
Knowledge workers need to be connected with appropriate individuals or resources
for knowledge at appropriate times to enable improved decision-making. There may need
to be new divisions of labor between humans and intelligent machines that are different
from those used previously in organizations due to the emergence of AI’s capabilities and
how they might be applied to achieve these objectives. New human and machine design
mindsets, as well as new skill sets and competencies, are required for these new jobs. To
be able to beneﬁt from their artiﬁcial partners in KM while avoiding such drawbacks of
automation as cognitive algorithmic aversion or complacency, humans need to cultivate
perspectives, skills, and work habits. The unique possibilities of AI in KM are only lever-
aged and realized via an efﬁcient symbiotic collaboration between intelligent systems and
knowledge workers, which actions by companies can help to realize.
Many see AI as the next major source of economic value, as a key technology at
the forefront of a new technological revolution and industrial change. Its fast expansion
presents enterprises with several possibilities inherent in and obstacles to the acquisition of
Computers 2023, 12, 72

important AI technology [25]. The current tendency in the development of AI technology
toward the improvement of entrepreneurs’ judgment and decision-making skills is a potent
instrument for promoting societal growth and advancement. Consequently, AI technology
is gaining in importance [26]. The following sections present the background of KM and AI.
2.1. Knowledge Management (KM)
For more than 30 years, KM has been a crucial ﬁeld that has explained how infor-
mation is produced, developed, maintained, and utilized within organization or nations
and encourages learning from the past and innovation [27]. As brieﬂy mentioned earlier,
KM is now one of the essential elements ﬁn leveraging competitive advantage to achieve
organizational success. It has long attracted interest and research indicates that it is an
academic discipline, but it can be developed at the organizational level, where it beneﬁts
employees and organizations. Knowledge management is an important component, but
an organizational theory has not yet been sufﬁciently established to explain its relevance,
nor has it been described it in a way that would capture the attention of companies. Orga-
nizations obtain a ﬁrmer grasp of their businesses and practices through the knowledge
they gain from their assets [28]. A business may beneﬁt from gathering information from
its assets by comparing its results, which can help it to navigate rapidly changing industry
environments. Similar to how corporations acquire information, people who belong to
organizations may develop their talents and provide greater value to these organizations by
having a thorough grasp of their organization’s knowledge. Although this interpretation is
straightforward, pre-existing knowledge poses a hazard, since it makes it more difﬁcult for
people and organizations to adjust to change, since they are unable to acquire new infor-
mation or adopt new practices [29]. According to the study by Suresh et al. [30], learning
these new procedures is necessary to enable the new processes of collecting and utilizing
pre-existing information at both the organizational and individual levels. However, this
can only be accomplished by changing the organizational culture and implementing these
new KM techniques.
The correct management of the opportunities presented by AI and the assignment of
supporting solutions to previously taken actions raise the organizational practice of KM to
a higher real level. This implies that solutions assisted by AI may be given to each stage
of a KM process (KMP), enabling stakeholders to take the appropriate action or complete
tasks that arise during the real phase more quickly, effectively, and successfully [31].
2.2. Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI)
Along with being a long-standing academic ﬁeld, AI is one of the most frequently used
phrases across a variety of economic sectors [32,33]. At the end of the 1980s and during
the early 1990s, AI developed into a multidisciplinary ﬁeld of study that includes virtual
reality, neural networks, expert systems, voice recognition, natural language processing,
and robots [34].
Haenlein and Kaplan [32] describe AI as a system’s capacity to successfully adapt
based on certain inputs and the impact of new knowledge, in order to carry out speciﬁc tasks
and activities. Additionally, in the same article, the researchers proposed two classiﬁcation
schemes for AI, one of which is based on the stages of development of AI, while the
other is based on the intelligence style shown by an AI system. Based on evolutionary
phases, an AI system’s intelligence may also be relational, emotive, or logical. Accordingly,
AI systems are categorized as analytical, sentient, or human-looking, depending on the
kind of intelligence they possess. Kumar et al. [35] deﬁned AI as a platform for limitless
potential and knowledge that might be constrained by tailored approaches. In addition,
Jarrahi [36] deﬁned the term as a set of instruments, strategies, and practices used inside an
organizational context in favor of ﬁrms and their stakeholders.
Artiﬁcial intelligence gives individuals and groups the power and possibility to in-
crease productivity and creativity at all organizational levels and makes it feasible to track
results. It makes it easier for businesses to accomplish their objectives in several areas and
Computers 2023, 12, 72

boosts their proﬁtability, giving them room to become more competitive, decrease expenses,
tighten security, and continuously offer data [37]. These changes improve the approaches
that may be used in the stages of the KMP. If successfully implemented, the adoption of AI
technology in KM provides enormous advantages (Figure 1).

3. Research Methodology
This critical analysis aims to assess the present level of AI in KM. For this investigation,
all current relevant literature was studied with the carefully. The review approach makes
considerable use of structured objectives, the Scopus database, and information-gathering
and -analysis techniques. To give a comprehensive and brief assessment of the study
subjects, a subset of the essential reporting components for critical reviews was selected.
3.1. Selection
The whole research process relied heavily on data retrieved from Scopus. All possible
sources were scoured to ensure the accuracy of the information presented here. However,
not all outstanding research works were included in the search parameters. There have
been 120 analyses of Scopus results thus far (10 January 2023). In total, 24 were deemed
signiﬁcant (Figure 2). Papers were selected for the evaluation by developing inclusion and
exclusion criteria and by identifying essential terms (see Table 1 for more detail).

3.2. Limitations
Critical reviews seldom include a comprehensive examination of all relevant research.
They are unable to assess the quality of the chosen studies, particularly qualitative studies
that lack a design hierarchy [38]. Moreover, critical reviews frequently fail to describe the
overall research strategy, the method used to select and exclude articles, the restrictions of
the search strategy, the effectiveness of the search procedure, and the methodology of the
analysis [39]. This database used for this review, Scopus, limited the review process.
4. Results and Discussion
4.1. Selection Results
This critical evaluation includes 24 articles. The chosen papers are listed below, along
with an explanation of the overall categorization ﬁndings.
4.2. Present State
Firms are no longer viewed as industries and are instead perceived from a knowledge
standpoint. Knowledge is employed as a resource in the current corporate environment [40].
This is particularly true given that successful businesses are those that recognize, assess,
and generate knowledge, as well as turning it into assets. To ensure more value is generated
to meet the needs of organizations and people, the knowledge life cycle, which begins
with progress and data and develops into information, followed by knowledge, need
to be shortened. Artiﬁcial intelligence capabilities are now added to information and
communications technology to ensure that companies take full advantage of what these
technologies have to offer.
In the majority of modern businesses, AI tools and systems are utilized extensively.
Mathematical logic, search heuristics, and pattern recognition are performed with these
instruments. In recent years, KM has attracted a growing amount of interest from industries
in which AI advancements are applicable [41]. Organizations can use intelligent agents
from various AI-related technologies, such as genetic algorithms, intelligent agents, and
neural networks, to perform tasks such as user proﬁling, semantic analysis of texts, text
mining, and pattern matching.
Artiﬁcial Intelligence technologies help enterprises to improve KM strategies. From
an AI standpoint, knowledge representation requires the familiarization of organizational
processes with this information [42]. This results in the automation of KM operations,
enabling computer systems to extract information and draw conclusions from knowledge
in a machine-interpretable format explored. The question of how much AI can contribute
to KM has been explored extensively.
This study presents a critical review obtained from the many papers released each
year, including subject categories, keyword density, document format, and author nation
distribution. Furthermore, this study concludes with an assessment of research publications
on AI and KM in the stated applications that were published between 2012 and 2022.

Table 2 presents the number of articles created for each subject area from 2012 to 2022.
Engineering (10 articles) and Computer Science were the major subjects (9 articles). With the
growth that Computer Science has experienced since 2019, it is anticipated that it will even-
tually match or surpass Engineering in terms of the number of papers, although engineering
typically contains more papers. Furthermore, the increase in Business, Management, and
Accounting indicates an expansion of the use of AI and KM in these ﬁelds.

Figure 3 shows the annual number of articles released from 2012 to 2022. The only
documents accessible from 2012 to 2018 were the two in 2014 and the two in 2018. The
following information demonstrates how publication dates have evolved throughout time:
ﬁve articles (21%) were published in 2019, four articles (17%) in 2020, two articles (8.3%)
in 2021, and eleven articles (46%) in 2022. It is noteworthy that in the ﬁeld of KM and
AI research, particularly in 2022, a considerable surge occurred. The highest number of
published studies in this ﬁeld occurred in 2022. In addition, there was a steady rise in
the number of publications published on the role of AI in KM during the last three years,
from 2012 to 2022. Over the years, adjustments were made to KM and the workplace. The
importance of information technology in KM has grown over the past few years. As a
system’s ability to use the knowledge acquired to achieve speciﬁc tasks and goals through
ﬂexible adaptation, AI has made signiﬁcant scientiﬁc progress over the past ten years [43].

Figure 4 illustrates the cloud words generated from the connection between the
keywords of the publications chosen for the critical literature study. The review found
that the phrases artiﬁcial intelligence, knowledge management, machine learning, and
knowledge acquisition were the most frequently used. The rapid advancement of AI,
especially in the application of machine learning in KM, can help organizations to optimize
the KM systems needed by businesses [44]. Machine learning can help in the acquisition of
complex data and the delivery of the critical solutions hidden within these assets [45].

4.3. Developments in Different Applications
Artiﬁcial Intelligence is a powerful tool that supports knowledge in all areas. This part-
nership aids the KMP because AI is constantly improving with new technology. Knowledge
is the key to both KM and AI. As a result, the efﬁciency that AI can provide to enterprises
acts as a tool for accessibility for their requirements. Only via scientiﬁc theory, knowledge
principles, and processes is it possible to comprehend the advantages and disadvantages of
KM and AI. Understanding power relations is crucial to understanding how AI and KM in-
teract, since individuals continuously debate their identities, rules, and futures while using
AI and KM to further their own or other people’s oppressive or oppositional initiatives [55].
There have been research studies on AI and KM, but few have been conducted on
how the two might be combined to improve businesses, organizations, wireless systems,
healthcare, tutorial, and innovations (Figure 6). The study by Alghanem et al. [50] illustrates
the relationship between KM practices and AI systems from a higher perspective, offering
various options for applying other KM practices to the same AI algorithm to mitigate
implementation issues and increase adoption. The research’s key result was the signiﬁcant
inﬂuence that certain KM activities, such as knowledge production and acquisition, had on
various AI systems and algorithms, providing businesses with alternative implementation
options. Additionally, the study reveals that the majority of studies concur that role-playing
may improve AI algorithms and systems and that KM techniques have the same effect.
The work by Sanzogni et al. [18] studies how AI can contribute to the KM discussion. To
advance the knowledge discussion, it investigates the function of tacit knowledge and the
theoretical boundaries of KM and AI. Expert knowledge can only be obtained by experience,
since it combines collective tacit knowledge, somatic tacit knowledge, and relational tacit
information (i.e., on-the-job learning). It is important to examine how people and AI-based
technology interact while carrying out KM-related activities. This research expands upon
previous works in the ﬁeld by providing a more comprehensive picture of how AI has been
used to improve the quality of KM.

The amount and appropriateness of the data obtained have a direct impact on the
quality of the decisions made; thus, at this point, AI techniques may be of great assistance.
They may be used, for example, by a company operating in a certain economic environment
to specify the information required for attaining strategic objectives and to deliver it via the
knowledge-production process. The conversion of enormous volumes of data into useful
information that may be utilized proactively in decision-making is a difﬁcult task. Data
gathering and analysis help managers to make logical strategic choices. Through synergies
and information-processing skills, information-technology-supported KM facilitates the
creation and use of operational efﬁciency and innovative capacities [56].
4.3.1. Business and Organizational
The literature currently in print describes the relevance of collaborative intelligence,
which results from an efﬁcient collaboration between human employees and AI systems
to produce outcomes that are important to organizations. On the elements impacting the
AI–human relationship and its effect on company success, there is, nevertheless, a dearth of
research ﬁndings. To close this knowledge gap, Chowdhury et al. [52] created and veriﬁed
a unique theoretical model focusing on how knowledge sharing, trust, workers’ AI abilities,
and job clarity relate to better business success. The model draws on the socio-technical
systems (STS), knowledge-based view (KBV), and organizational socialization framework
(OSF). With the aid of these discoveries, managers and the AI community will be able to
establish collaborative intelligence capabilities inside their organizations.
The aim of the article by Chatterjee et al. [46] is to pinpoint the key success factors
(CSFs) for an AI-integrated customer-relationship-management system that would enhance
KM in enterprises and boost operational efﬁciency. The suggested interpretive structural
model serves as a thorough and efﬁcient roadmap for enhancing performance when us-
ing AI-customer-relationship management to support KM environments. The ﬁndings
indicate that senior-management backing is necessary for the effective implementation
of AI-integrated customer-relationship-management systems to improve KM and, conse-
quently, to enhance company processes. The goal of the paper by Baierle et al. [54] was
to discuss the creation of a knowledge-based system that, with the help of rules, may
assist the decision-making procedures of a company’s sales department. By using the
knowledge-based system, the decision-making process may be made more reliable and
ﬂexible, and it is also feasible to model probable future business scenarios. All of the
study’s factors are signiﬁcant to the decision-making process in some way, and they need
to be examined collectively to produce a trustworthy conclusion; otherwise, a poor choice
may be made, which would harm how the implementation of the company’s plan. The
major contribution of Baierle et al.’s case study is its revelation of how a knowledge-based
system helped a ﬁrm in the south of Brazil’s sales sector to discover a suitable solution to a
business issue. The goal of Bencsik’s [56] theoretical research was to create a framework
that, beginning with the business model and using the synergy of KM and AI, outlines
a way to predict the success of future innovations while ensuring the strategy’s viability
through the use of appropriate managerial decisions. The study’s output is a model for
anticipating successful innovation that, when used in the knowledge-creation stage of KM
Computers 2023, 12, 72
10 of 18
with AI assistance, offers the foundation for making the best managerial choices to ensure
the attainment of strategic objectives. The model’s actual implementation in business oper-
ations encourages managerial foresight and judgments concerning innovative investments
that have an impact on organizational performance.
The goal of the study by Leoni et al. [57] is to provide and empirically test a con-
ceptual model in which supply-chain resilience, KMPs, and AI are all taken into account
simultaneously in terms of their reciprocal relationships and effects on manufacturing
ﬁrms’ performance. This research shows that KMPs need to be carefully considered as a
mediating mechanism for manufacturing enterprises interested in correctly using AI to
improve their performance and resilience. The work by Alshadoodee et al. [58] demon-
strates how KM-based administrative-decision-support systems may be improved using
AI. The administration of a private college is used in the research as a variable on which
the ﬁndings are dependent. Most methods for managing business activities that advance
organization and administration delivery have been improved by technological advances.
Businesses in this sector need to gradually move into the digitization of all industrial cycles,
and business processes connected to administration; increasingly, the same can be said of
crucial services in educational institutions. The knowledge required to form the basis of
an efﬁcient and effective educational system still features signiﬁcant limitations due to the
requirement for competent decision-making assistance utilizing KM for good governance
and to enhance the reputation of particular institutions.
4.3.2. General Innovation
To increase the expansion of awareness of the digitalization of the construction sector,
organizational structures and business establishments need to build creative and problem-
solving procedures. The work by Botega and da Silva [51] aims to demonstrate a creative
support system capable of handling this volume of data and offering insights to enhance
the development of new products. The validation procedure conﬁrms the applicability
of the strategy and suggests improvements for further advances. This knowledge-based
system may be useful in teaching Design and Engineering students about crucial facets
of creativity and the selection process for approaches, as well as in real-world-application
situations and exchanging information on creative and innovative techniques. An AI-based
KM fuzzy-assessment-algorithm-evaluation model was used in the research by Liu and
Zhang [59] to assess the innovative KM of 16 universities. During the process of establishing
the model, the network architecture, activation function, learning parameters, and neural
network algorithm were determined. The model was trained and validated using learning-
sample data. The ﬁndings of the assessment indicated that the suggested model for
evaluating universities’ innovative knowledge, based on the fuzzy algorithm and the AI
algorithm, is operable, scientiﬁc, and applicable. The results were in line with the year’s
real assessment ﬁndings, which illustrates the fuzziness of university innovations in KM,
according to fuzzy AI, which was used to evaluate the algorithm. The results demonstrate
the viability of the evaluative approach. The study by Bokhari and Myeong [60] aims to
use KM-based service-science theory and the diffusion-of-innovation theory to examine
the quantitative link between smart-city performance, innovation, e-governance, and
technology-oriented KM. The study revealed that the direct links are contextual because
innovation mediates the relationship between e-service delivery and KM, and e-governance
mediates the relationship between e-service delivery and innovation.
Liu [61]’s work investigates the most signiﬁcant effects of AI on the management
of knowledge innovation and the most inﬂuential variables in this process. The ﬁndings
demonstrate that AI had a substantial effect on the dynamic components, capacity elements,
environmental elements, and stock management of information ﬂow. Artiﬁcial Intelligence
has endogenous effects on improvements in the ﬂow of knowledge and network diffusion.
Artiﬁcial Intelligence technology fostered the construction of unique technical innovations
and had a clear automatic-recognition function in new knowledge, which stimulated the
principal internal transmission power of innovation in knowledge. Moreover, AI acti-
Computers 2023, 12, 72

vated the energy level of original invention and progressive technological advancements,
which were mostly derived from the innovation system’s profound ﬂowing knowledge.
The deep-runoff-knowledge-transfer efﬁciency and retention rate were modiﬁed by the
knowledge network. The penetration rate of AI inﬂuenced the intelligent industry’s scope
for collaboration and the application of integrated knowledge. The goal of the study by
Arias-Pérez and Cepeda-Cardona [62] is to examine the moderating impact of the tech-
nological upheaval created by AI on the interaction between classic KM techniques of
personalizing codiﬁcation (explicit knowledge) and tacit knowledge, as well as organiza-
tional improvisation, which refers to a ﬁrm’s capacity to generate ideas and react to changes
in the technological environment in real-time. Codiﬁcation and customization both have
a considerably positive impact on improvisation; the effect of the former is stronger than
that of the latter. The association between personalization and improvisation, however, is
weaker when technological upheaval created by AI occurs, but the tie between codiﬁcation
and improvisation is stronger.
4.3.3. Tutorial
Artiﬁcial Intelligence may boost the knowledge of employees through reskilling and
upskilling, for example. Organizations may use this information to offer targeted devel-
opment and training as AI systems become more aware of human talents and actions.
The paper by Bilquise and Shaalan [63] examines the problems with the current advisory
system from the viewpoint of KM and suggests an integrated AI-based framework to deal
with primary advising duties. The study proposes three AI-based systems to improve
the current advisory process: a rule-based expert system that recommends courses and
generates study plans for the upcoming semester; an early machine-learning-based system
for the detection of students at risk of failing a course; and conversational AI chatbots to
offer students individualized digital support. All three systems work together to provide
advisors and students with individualized help and direction using the information in
the current information system. The tutorial by Kalidindi [48] covers the basic ideas that
support the newly developed AI-based materials knowledge system (AI–MKS) architecture
methodically. To capture the process–structure–property linkages across a hierarchy of
material structure/length scales, these approaches focus on feature-engineering the internal
structure of heterogeneous materials to generate low-dimension representations, which
may be combined with machine-learning models to construct low-computational-cost
surrogate models. This framework, known as materials knowledge systems (MKS), suc-
cessfully merges current AI/machine-learning toolsets with the current experimental and
physics-based simulation toolsets utilized by domain experts in the materials business.
The tutorial’s main objective is to lay the groundwork for domain experts to comprehend
and seize the opportunities that will result from the synergistic integration of AI/machine-
learning technologies into ongoing efforts to create new materials, while also outlining a
clear course of action for achieving this objective.
Through the mediating impact of the learning environment in the Saudi Arabian
service industry, Baslom and Tong [64]’s research sought to investigate the empirical link
between awareness of AI and the strategic management of organizational knowledge. The
data from the targeted respondents were gathered using both questionnaire and interview
methodologies, and a structured questionnaire was produced for better comprehension.
The results of the factor analysis show that all the indicators of the learning environment,
strategic KM, and awareness of AI had excellent factor loadings. The results from a struc-
tural equation model of the strategic management of information and awareness of AI show
that knowledge distribution, knowledge acquisition, and knowledge responsiveness all
signiﬁcantly and favorably inﬂuence AI awareness. The association between AI and knowl-
edge acquisition, as well as the relationship between information dissemination and AI,
are both considerably mediated by the learning climate (LC), according to research on the
mediating inﬂuence of the LC. However, the LC’s role as a mediator between knowledge re-
sponsiveness and AI is minimal. Yang et al. [65] suggested an intelligent-knowledge-based
Computers 2023, 12, 72
12 of 18
recommender system (IKRS) for smart education utilizing AI. The suggestions were created
via the evolutionary algorithm and the K-nearest neighbor algorithm (KNN) by applying
the optimal weights to attribute vectors that reﬂect the learner’s viewpoints. The experi-
mental results showed that the suggested IKRS model improves learning quality, student
engagement levels, and student–teacher interactions, and predicts students’ learning styles
when compared to other existing methodologies. Based on their ﬁndings, Sun and Gu [66]
conclude that a knowledge graph for AI-assisted smart education has the potential to bring
together the subject-matter expertise of discipline experts and teaching experience, enhance
the machine’s ability to communicate with humans, and provide knowledge-driven and
data-driven information-processing techniques.
4.3.4. Wireless Systems
Artiﬁcial Intelligence may be used to improve a wide range of wireless-technology
capabilities. Gacanin [47] provides a vision for knowledge-driven wireless operations
using AI techniques, including active learning, KM, reasoning, and sense. The purpose of
combining KM with active learning, reasoning, and sense is to give readers inspiration,
as well as a huge general data-independent AI approach for autonomous agents in the
context of real-time self-organization. In another study, Gacanin et al. [53] provide a brand-
new idea for a KM framework to allow self-learning and self-optimization for real-time
wireless-system operation. An AI-based self-deployment framework was tested in several
indoor situations, including residential and business settings with dense deployments
of nearby access points that caused interference and contention, using the testbed and
standard compliance simulator, ns-3. The agent gained sufﬁcient information from previous
activities, enhancing the caliber of judgments made in the future. The agent was given
domain knowledge to use as a guide while discovering and taking advantage of a range of
potential behaviors in the environment. To deal with the non-deterministic polynomial-
time hardness problem of combining channel and location optimization in a wireless
system, the agent ensures that learning is low-cost and creates a network setup that is
close to optimal. For non-stationary wireless extenders, Gacanin et al. [67] provide a self-
deployment technique in which both back-haul and front-haul connections are optimized.
Intelligent Channel Assignment and Location Optimization (ICALO) is a self-optimization
approach for wireless extenders in wireless-mesh networks that use a learning framework
powered by AI. The ICALO method optimizes the operating channels and locations of
extenders by achieving a balance between their back-haul and front-haul performance while
taking into account the inﬂuence of uncoordinated adjacent networks, learning cost, and
network dynamics. Gacanin et al.’s ﬁndings demonstrate considerable throughput increases
through a variety of different channel-assignment techniques, as well as a considerably
quicker convergence to peak performance, with fewer actions than unguided reinforcement
learning. The authors offer a case-based reasoning framework for AI that allows self-
deployment with environment learning via sensing and perception. By balancing the
exploration and exploitation of the search space, problem-speciﬁc optimization and semi-
supervised learning generate new actions or extender positions.
4.3.5. Healthcare
Knowledge management is essential to the healthcare industry because it fosters
improved practitioner cooperation and enhances patient outcomes. To reduce the strain on
healthcare workers and, eventually, save them money, AI can automate certain operations.
A healthcare KM system is presented by Phan et al. [68] to enable the systematic generation
of knowledge on varied data in hospitals. The outcomes of their research show that the
system ensures the knowledge-generation process, allowing knowledge exploitation and
exploration to improve healthcare-decision making. The knowledge system was used for
the identiﬁcation and categorization of cerebral bleeding and high blood pressure in text and
CT/MRI image formats, respectively, using hospital medical data. It may assist physicians
in correctly diagnosing ailments so they can provide effective treatment plans. The purpose
Computers 2023, 12, 72
13 of 18
of Ziuzianski et al. [49]’s study was to outline the dashboard implementation technique
in e-health KM and to illustrate the current status of e-health AI systems. Performance
dashboards link data sources and show data to enable quicker and more precise decision-
making. According to their dashboard project using epidemiological data in Poland,
Ziuzanski et al. described the various epidemiological data sources and presented a
case study. As shown by the examples given by the authors, the use of these kinds of
systems in e-health has considerably increased in recent years. Given the gaps in healthcare
systems shown by the COVID-19 pandemic, Nasseef et al. [69] explored the consequences
of using an AI-driven public-healthcare framework to enhance decision-making concerning
the effect of government-to-government (G2G) interactions. The issue representation in
Knowledge-based Exchange on AI-based COVID-19 Diagnosis (AI-D) demonstrates how
the solver was cognitively active in processing knowledge about the target problem while
using an AI-based COVID-19 task solution. The solver’s present comprehension of the
issue’s substance is closely tied to this representation as a consequence of the external
AI-based COVID-19 problem representations.
Table 4 provides a summary of the papers reviewed in this study, listed from top to
bottom by citation. This is based on the papers’ areas of focus, including general innova-
tion, healthcare, businesses and organizations, wireless systems, and tutorials. Artiﬁcial
Intelligence has already made a signiﬁcant contribution to the excellence and effectiveness
of KM in terms of thinking and problem-solving methods, as well as through optimization
systems, scheduling, decision-support systems, planning, intelligent tutors, modeling and
processing, and knowledge acquisition, as evidenced by the aforementioned examples [70].

4.4. Future Directions
As mentioned in the literature, KMP is crucial to the success of ﬁrms, since it ulti-
mately leads to a competitive advantage. The integration KM with machine learning and
natural language algorithms connected to AI technology is quite beneﬁcial. This may
facilitate corporate operations and save expenses. It is recommended that the public sector
implement this technology to minimize the time required for assigning and recording
customer-service data.
The digital age is the fourth industrial revolution to affect the construction sector.
Building-information modeling, virtual reality, unmanned aerial vehicles, and AI are
employed and integrated into the industry’s daily responsibilities to facilitate more efﬁcient
operations. Knowledge management originated during the early and mid-1990s, as a
corporate technique to increase productivity and quality. After decades of study on KM, it
was found that the research on AI and KM complement one another in terms of generating
better procedures to facilitate better KM.
The use of knowledge management as a business strategy offers ﬁrms a competitive
advantage that enables them to outperform their rivals. The successful use of KM can
enhance revenues, reduce resource exploitation, boost savings, and provide a noticeable
increase in user acceptance [71]. Knowledge management supports the formation of an
atmosphere conducive to education and learning, both of which are considered advantages
to businesses, since workers are encouraged continue their education, acquire new skills,
and assume leadership positions, and are often rewarded as a result. To become more
competitive, organizations need to make fundamental adjustments to their strategic plans
to better meet the needs of local markets. When implemented into a strategic conﬁguration,
KM facilitates the comprehension of local environments by discriminating between diverse
institutions, entity demands, and consumer preferences [72]. Today’s global economies are
changing at an unprecedented rate. In this changing environment, whether on a local or
global scale, ﬁrms want personnel who are precisely taught to detect critical information
and expertise. Consequently, businesses may increase their production via the strategic
use of KM [56]. The patterns found in the study by Cantu-Ortiz et al. [73] indicate that
autonomous systems and other AI technologies, including robotics, computer vision, voice
recognition, IoT, and other related ﬁelds, have little interaction with KM at present, but
have high potential to fertilize KM, particularly in the period covering 2026–2030, after an
incubation period spanning 2020–2025.
The availability of authorized data is one of the major issues facing the present AI
sector. Internet systems with decentralized, publicly accessible databases offer the ability
to solve this problem. The analysis and processing of the data inherited by blockchain
led to the creation of a priceless body of knowledge and the monetization of blockchain
information for both enterprises and AI developers. Many opportunities exist to put this
information to use in the real world to produce innovations in or revolutionize business
models, including infrastructure for electric vehicles, intelligent autonomous supply chains,
smart homes, smart cities, decentralized banking, and the exchange of commodities [74].
Despite the lack of acceptance of AI and effective KM tools, the digitization of the
construction sector has led to the use of AI tools. This demonstrates that AI will soon be
utilized to support KM across sectors; nevertheless, there are greater applications for AI in
the context of KM that may have a signiﬁcant effect and help organizations and enterprises.
Recent research reveals that the great majority of AI expenditures have little to no effect [75].
Decades of studies suggest that organizational changes need to accompany IT deployment
for the latter to be effective. These are called organizational supplements [76].
5. Conclusions
Knowledge management is the process of creating, using, sharing, and managing an
organization’s information and knowledge. Traditional KM has evolved over the years, but
documentation has always served as its base. Nonetheless, the considerable shift toward
remote and hybrid labor has shown deﬁciencies in present practices. These voids will
Computers 2023, 12, 72
15 of 18
be ﬁlled by AI, which will also affect how KM is converted and operated. Although AI
has been implemented by few businesses because of the initial investment required, ﬁrms
hesitate because they are unaware of the full advantages of AI and how it may improve
KM inside teams. To determine the difference between business processes without AI for
KM and those that use AI to aid KM, it is necessary to conduct a study of the use of AI to
beneﬁt KM across various industries. This article examines research published between
2012 and 2022 on AI and KM, with a focus on how AI may assist enterprises in their efforts
to properly manage knowledge and information. Based on the ﬁndings of this study, KM
has been intensively studied over the years, but there is still much to learn and no single
approach can be stated to be the best for managing knowledge inside organizations or
companies. Recent years have seen a rise in industry interest in AI, as the construction
industry has entered its fourth industrial revolution and becomes more digitized. Most
organizations in the construction sector have been hesitant to implement AI because it
requires a substantial initial investment, including the hiring of personnel who are capable
of interacting with the machines. Moreover, these businesses have struggled to adopt
efﬁcient KM systems. Accordingly, the number of works on AI and KM is increasing in
various areas, such as engineering, computer science, business, management, etc.
This study reviewed how the combination of AI and KM could enhance innovations,
wireless networks, education, healthcare, businesses, and organizations. The results of
numerous studies demonstrate that AI has already greatly improved the quality and
effectiveness of KM with regard to knowledge acquisition, problem-solving strategies,
knowledgeable tutors, optimal solution systems, organization, modeling, etc. However,
there are more advanced potential applications for AI in the context of KM, which may
have a signiﬁcant impact and aid groups and enterprises. Artiﬁcial Intelligence will
soon be used as a support for KM across sectors. To improve the uses and efﬁcacy of
these ﬁelds, more research is required in the future. Blockchain may be able to solve the
aforementioned problems and enhance KM. As the organizations’ knowledge capacity
improves, the problem of knowledge storage may be solved and the sharing of knowledge
may be improved. This could serve as a beneﬁcial research topic for further study.

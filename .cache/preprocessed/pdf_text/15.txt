Abstract: Health information systems (HISs) have immense value for healthcare institutions, as they
provide secure storage, efficient retrieval, insightful analysis, seamless exchange, and collaborative
sharing of patient health information. HISs are implemented to meet patient needs, as well as to
ensure the security and privacy of medical data, including confidentiality, integrity, and availability,
which are necessary to achieve high-quality healthcare services. This systematic literature review
identifies various technologies and methods currently employed to enhance the security and privacy
of medical data within HISs. Various technologies have been utilized to enhance the security and
privacy of healthcare information, such as the IoT, blockchain, mobile health applications, cloud
computing, and combined technologies. This study also identifies three key security aspects, namely,
secure access control, data sharing, and data storage, and discusses the challenges faced in each
aspect that must be enhanced to ensure the security and privacy of patient information in HISs.
Keywords: health information systems; healthcare; medical data; security; privacy
1. Introduction
Described as comprehensive, technology-based systems, health information systems
(HISs) are designed to manage and organize health data and information. These systems
assist healthcare organizations in storing, retrieving, analyzing, and exchanging patient
health information, thereby supporting clinical decision-making and enhancing patient
care and outcomes. HISs typically include a range of software applications and tools for
electronic health records (EHRs), health information exchange, clinical decision support
(CDS), and administrative functions. These systems are versatile, being used in various
settings such as hospitals, clinics, long-term care facilities, public health agencies, and even
at home. HISs also play a pivotal role in enhancing data security and privacy, supporting
compliance with regulations like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
(HIPAA) [1].
The increase in digitalization of patient health information through electronic health
records and personal health records has created new and serious threats to patient infor-
mation security and privacy [2]. Medical data containing sensitive information about a
patient’s health and personal life, including medical history, diagnoses, treatments, and
personal identifying information, are vulnerable to breaches. Such breaches can lead to
serious consequences, including identity theft, fraud, and medical malpractice [3]. The
security of patient data encourages individuals to share their personal health information
for current or future care [3]. Furthermore, if healthcare professionals cannot trust an
organization to protect records, they may be reluctant to record all information collected
from patients [4]. Therefore, it is essential that HISs are designed and implemented with
privacy and security as core considerations [4]. This includes using secure technologies
for storing and transmitting data, implementing access controls, and providing training
to healthcare professionals on best practices for ensuring patient security and privacy.

Moreover, ensuring the security and privacy of medical data, including confidentiality,
integrity, and availability, is necessary to achieve high-quality healthcare services [3,4].

Previous literature reviews have mainly focused on the use of a particular type of
technology, such as blockchain and the Internet of Things (IoT) [5,6]. So far, most of
these studies have not comprehensively explained and reviewed the various technologies
for ensuring the privacy and security of medical data. Therefore, the literature review
presented in this paper attempts to perform a comprehensive review to evaluate the security
and privacy aspects of different technologies used in health information systems and to
analyze their advantages, limitations, and future directions.
This literature review includes studies that utilize various technologies to enhance the
security and privacy of healthcare information. These technologies can be analyzed from
three security aspects, namely, secure access control, secure data sharing, and secure data
storage. To address data security and privacy, these technologies provide different secure
schemes, such as secure frameworks, secure authentication protocols, privacy-preserving
infrastructures, data storage, and access control models [7,8].
In this literature review, four current technologies are evaluated, namely, mobile health
applications, the IoT, blockchain, and cloud computing, along with other methods that
employ a combination of technologies. It should be noted that mobile applications and the
IoT are different because they serve different purposes and have various characteristics,
such as distinct features and functionalities, different access points, diverse operating
systems, and varied threats, including different security and privacy risks and required
security countermeasures. For instance, mobile devices may require additional encryption
or multi-factor authentication for access to sensitive health information, while IoT devices
may require additional controls to ensure the privacy and security of the data they collect
and transmit.
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 gives a brief overview of
related concepts. Section 3 illustrates the research methodology. In Section 4, results from
the literature review are presented. Section 5 presents a discussion and Section 6 concludes
this paper.
2. Background
Security in the context of medical data and health information refers to the protection
of sensitive patient information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. It encom-
passes various measures to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of health
Computers 2024, 13, 41

data [9]. Privacy, on the other hand, is a specific aspect of security that focuses on enforcing
rules regarding how private information is stored and shared. Medical data privacy is
important because it ensures that patients have control over who can access their health
information and how it is used. This helps to maintain confidentiality and prevent the unau-
thorized use or disclosure of medical data, which can lead to identity theft, discrimination,
and other negative consequences [9].
Therefore, attempts to create policies and regulations have been developed in various
countries. For example, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
of 1996 consists of federal laws that protect the privacy and security of health information
in the U.S. These rules ensure that individuals have rights over their health information,
and they require specific protections to safeguard electronic health information [10]. All
companies operating in the healthcare industry in the U.S. must comply with HIPAA regula-
tions. This includes healthcare providers, health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and their
business associates. The HIPAA provides a comprehensive set of guidelines for ensuring
the privacy and security of health information [3]. The key guidelines comprise a security
rule, privacy rule, breach notification rule, and enforcement rule. The security rule outlines
the security standards to protect electronic protected health information (ePHI). It includes
administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity,
and availability of ePHI. The privacy rule establishes national standards for protecting
individuals’ medical records and other personal health information. It governs the use and
disclosure of PHI and grants a patient their rights over their own health information. In
the event of a breach involving unsecured PHI, entities that comply with the HIPAA are
required to notify affected individuals, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and, in
some cases, the media. Enforcement rules outline procedures for investigating complaints
and the penalties for non-compliance with HIPAA regulations [3,11].
Accordingly, the privacy and security of HISs are crucial to ensure the confidentiality
of a patient’s personal information and to prevent potential security breaches that may
compromise the integrity of the data. Additionally, access control tools and extensive
training are essential for securing patient information and protecting confidentiality [10].
The organization and implementation of security and privacy in HISs can vary significantly
depending on the country and the type of provider or user. This variation is primarily
due to differences in legal frameworks, cultural attitudes toward privacy, technological
infrastructure, and the specific needs of healthcare providers and users. For example,
the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is one of the most
comprehensive and stringent privacy laws, impacting how companies worldwide handle
the data of EU citizens [12]. In contrast, the United States has a more sector-specific
approach, with laws like the HIPAA for healthcare data and the Children’s Online Privacy
Protection Act (COPPA) for protecting data for children. On the other hand, Australia’s
approach to health information privacy is outlined in the Privacy Act 1988, which includes
the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) [12]. These principles cover a broader spectrum of
personal information compared to the U.S.’s HIPAA and apply to a wider range of entities,
including all private health service providers [12].
In the context of HISs, approval and control of whether rules, requirements, and
guidelines are followed, including the conducting of audits and inspections, are overseen
by various regulatory bodies and government agencies. For instance, the HIPAA sets
standards for the storage, sharing, and management of health information, and the Office
of the Inspector General is involved in enforcing compliance through audits and investiga-
tions [13]. Furthermore, validation of HISs increasingly includes aspects of security and
privacy. This is essential given the sensitive nature of health data and the evolving cyberse-
curity threat landscape. Modern validation methodologies for e-health systems focus on
ensuring that security and privacy policies are effectively integrated and compliant with
relevant regulations and standards. These methodologies typically involve a combination
of technological advancements, adherence to legal frameworks, and the application of best
practices in data security and privacy management. The goal is to ensure the confidentiality,
Computers 2024, 13, 41

integrity, and availability of health data throughout its lifecycle, from collection to storage
and processing. The validation process often includes rigorous testing and assessment
of security measures, privacy protocols, and compliance with laws like the HIPAA in the
U.S. or the GDPR in the EU. This approach is crucial to safeguarding patient data against
unauthorized access, breaches, and other security incidents [13].
In the landscape of Health Information Systems (HISs), regulatory bodies such as the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA)
play pivotal roles. These organizations are fundamental in establishing and enforcing
standards that ensure the safety, efficacy, and privacy of health technologies. The FDA, in
the United States, oversees the regulation of medical devices, which include software and
hardware used in HISs. It sets forth guidelines that dictate how these technologies should
be developed, tested, and implemented to protect patient data and ensure system integrity.
Similarly, the EMA in the European Union performs an analogous function, focusing on
the evaluation and supervision of medicinal products, thereby extending its influence to
the technologies employed in healthcare settings across Europe [14].
These regulatory bodies also have a significant impact on how HIS technologies evolve
and are adopted in healthcare practices. By setting stringent requirements for compliance,
they influence the design and functionality of HIS technologies, prioritizing patient data
security and privacy. Compliance with these regulations is not just a legal obligation
but also a critical factor in gaining trust and acceptance among healthcare providers and
patients. While these agencies primarily aim to protect public health, their guidelines also
spur innovation, as developers and providers strive to create solutions that meet these
rigorous standards without compromising on efficiency and user experience. Thus, the
function and position of the FDA, EMA, and similar regulatory bodies are integral to the
development and deployment of secure and privacy-compliant HIS technologies [14].
3. Materials and Methods
This systematic literature review followed the PRISMA guidelines [15], using an
explicit and systematic search strategy and established inclusion and exclusion criteria.
The search was conducted on five databases (Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, Medline,
and IEEE) to collect articles about the privacy and security of health information systems.
During the querying phase, specific keywords were used to search for relevant articles.
The search string used was (“medical date” OR “patient data” OR “health data”) AND
(“privacy” OR “security” OR “data security”) AND (“health information systems” OR
“information technology” OR “digital health” OR “health informatics”) with additional
constraints: i.e., journal articles only, articles published in English, and articles published
from 2002 to 2022.
As shown in Table 2, the search returned 1273 articles. All retrieved articles were
imported to EndNote X20. At this stage, 559 duplicate references were removed, which left
714 papers for the initial screening process. During the initial screening stage, the titles and
abstracts of all 714 research papers were assessed.
The research team developed a set of criteria to determine article eligibility for this
review. The primary inclusion criteria for this research are the following: (1) articles
describing the privacy and security of medical data in health information systems and
(2) articles about secure technologies or solutions for storing and exchanging medical data.
Additionally, (1) literature reviews, (2) articles that provide general information or generic
reports related to medical data without describing solutions or methods for ensuring the
privacy of medical data, and (3) articles that published their methodology or design for
studies that have not been completed yet were excluded.
From the data in Table 2, based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, a further
514 articles were removed, leaving 116 articles for full-text review. After filtering and
selection, 36 studies were included in this review. Figure 1 summarizes the inclusion and
exclusion criteria and the steps of the proposed search using the PRISMA flow diagram.

4.1. Mobile Health Application
Mobile devices play an important role in the management of medical data in health
information science. However, organizations must ensure that appropriate security and
privacy measures are in place to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access or
theft. These privacy and security measures align with the proposals of Ref. [7], who suggest
threat modelling to identify potential threats and possible mitigations. By integrating
security policies, defining sensitivity levels of form fields, and corresponding security
mechanisms, data security can be catered to as early as the design phase. In addition,
articles [8,16–18] implement secure models to strengthen the privacy and security of medical
data within mHealth applications. These models aim to protect sensitive health information
throughout its lifecycle, from collection and transmission to storage and access. For instance,
Ref. [16] suggests a lightweight security framework for securing mHealth data collection
systems, relying on lightweight and low-cost mechanisms to secure data exchanged with
servers. These findings emphasize the importance of implementing strong encryption
techniques for both data in transit and data at rest. This includes encrypting communication
channels between devices and servers, as well as storing medical data on mobile devices
and in the cloud [8]. For example, Ref. [8] proposes a scheme called an Efficient and
Provable Secure Certificate-Based Combined Signature, Encryption, and Signcryption
(CBCSES) scheme. This scheme not only provides encryption and signcryption but also
offers an encryption or signature model when needed.
Moreover, mHealth applications can be designed using a secure framework for data
collection, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access or theft of information. This con-
tributes to securing the data exchanged with the server and includes key features such as
tolerance to delays and lack of connectivity [7,16]. A previous study identified the need to
use secure cloud storage for storing data, which can provide additional backup and secu-
rity measures [17]. The system proposed in [17] offers salient features including efficient
key management, privacy-preserving data storage and retrieval—particularly effective in
emergency situations—and auditability to prevent misuse of health data. Furthermore,
an approach presented in [18] utilized privacy-aware anomaly detection methods. These
Computers 2024, 13, 41
14 of 25
prioritize the security of health data by identifying abnormal patterns and ensuring the
privacy of individual users, thus helping to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of
sensitive health information [18].
4.2. IoT
The Internet of Things (IoT) has the potential to transform healthcare by enabling data
collection and exchange from various devices and sensors. IoT devices feature built-in
security measures, including encryption and authentication, to protect data in transit and
storage while ensuring access is restricted to authorized parties [28].
IoT devices can store and organize medical data, simplifying access and analysis for
healthcare professionals [19]. A new shared, agnostic, and permissioned decentralized data
layer enhances data availability. This architecture has been implemented in a real-world
Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) application [19], effectively handling sensitive data by
preserving privacy and ensuring data availability without third-party reliance. Additionally,
the IoT enhances data security and privacy through encryption, robust authentication, and
access control, ensuring that sensitive health data are accessible only to authorized parties,
thereby making unauthorized access more challenging [20–24].
It is important to note that IoT applications in healthcare offer cost reduction and
efficiency benefits. These applications streamline operations, minimize errors and waste,
and reduce system costs [21]. The focus in [21] was on avoiding the key escrow problem and
establishing a new session key between servers and personal digital assistants (PDAs) for
future communication, enhancing cost-effectiveness, and security against various attacks.
Remote monitoring contributes to shorter hospital stays and fewer readmissions, improving
treatment outcomes and reducing healthcare costs [21,25]. Furthermore, Ref. [25] discusses
using an edge server to compute data authenticators to verify data integrity, significantly
reducing computational costs and the management burden on third-party verifiers.
4.3. Blockchain
Extensive research has established that blockchain technology offers a secure, trans-
parent, and tamper-proof method for storing and sharing medical data, which is crucial for
maintaining patient privacy and security within HISs. Operating on a decentralized net-
work, blockchain technology lacks a central authority controlling the data. This approach
mitigates the risk of a single point of failure or a single entity accessing sensitive infor-
mation, addressing potential security issues inherent in centralized storage systems [28].
Additionally, Ref. [28] discovered that blockchain technology can overcome challenges
related to interoperability, security, confidentiality, privacy protection, and secure storage.
Similarly, Ref. [27] integrated two decentralized technologies, the Solid ecosystem and
blockchain, using solidity-based smart contracts to resolve security issues, thereby provid-
ing a secure, patient-centric design for complex, developing electronic health record (EHR)
data exchange.
Blockchain technology can also create secure private networks for sharing sensitive
medical data (transferred and distributed) exclusively among authorized parties [33,49].
For example, Ref. [33] proposes a permissioned blockchain-based system for EHR data
sharing and integration, employing public key infrastructure-based asymmetric encryption
and digital signatures to secure EHR data. This system ensures patient privacy protection
and adheres to healthcare data management requirements, including the access control
policy specified by the patient. Similarly, Ref. [32] introduced a privacy-preserving medical
data-sharing scheme that balances the need for privacy with the necessity of data sharing.
This perspective aligns with Ref. [49], who utilized a blockchain-based secure data sharing
mechanism for the safe uploading and sharing of health data. The study by Ref. [31]
developed a blockchain-based system with a secure data storage architecture to tackle
cybersecurity storage challenges, employing private data collection to ensure privacy and
decentralizing nodes in the network to prevent storage complications. This method also
addresses other security challenges typically associated with centralized systems. Further-
Computers 2024, 13, 41
15 of 25
more, blockchain technology enables the creation of smart contracts that automate data
sharing under predefined conditions, ensuring that data are only shared with authorized
parties. In line with this, Ref. [30] developed an access control framework based on smart
contracts, which is built on a distributed ledger (blockchain), to secure the sharing of
electronic medical records among various entities in the smart healthcare system.
In the context of blockchain applications in HISs, patient autonomy is a central theme,
allowing individuals to have ownership and control over their personal health data. This
empowerment is crucial, yet it poses challenges, particularly when patients are cognitively
impaired or unable to manage their data. In such cases, the use of advanced directives or
legally authorized representatives could be integrated into blockchain systems to ensure
responsible data management [26]. Moreover, blockchain’s decentralized nature and cryp-
tographic techniques provide robust security for health data [27]. However, challenges
arise in maintaining consistent permissions, especially in emergency situations where swift
access to patient data is crucial. Smart contracts and cryptographic keys within blockchain
networks can be employed to manage permissions seamlessly, ensuring healthcare profes-
sionals have necessary access while maintaining patient privacy and data integrity [30].
Furthermore, the legal implications of using blockchain in HISs under different juris-
dictions, such as the potential access by the U.S. government to cloud-stored data under U.S.
law, raise significant privacy concerns. While blockchain offers many benefits for healthcare
data security, its integration into existing healthcare systems must be approached with
caution, ensuring adherence to regulations like the HIPAA and addressing potential privacy
issues related to decentralized data storage. This necessitates a careful balance between
technological innovation and compliance with legal and regulatory standards.
4.4. Cloud Computing
Cloud computing offers multiple advantages for ensuring the security and privacy of
medical data in HISs. By adopting cloud-based solutions, healthcare organizations benefit
from strong security controls, encryption, access controls, redundancy, and compliance
certifications, all aimed at safeguarding patient data. The findings of this review indi-
cate that cloud computing providers can implement robust access control mechanisms.
These include multi-factor authentication and role-based access control, ensuring that
only authorized personnel can access sensitive medical data, thereby enhancing security
measures [36,38].
Moreover, cloud computing can be more cost-effective compared to maintaining
an on-premises IT infrastructure. This efficiency comes from eliminating the need for
expensive hardware and software, allowing healthcare organizations to reduce costs and
improve their overall financial performance [36]. Cloud computing also guarantees data
recovery following a disaster, further bolstering data security and privacy [17,37]. For
instance, a study by Ref. [37] describes a secure encryption algorithm (SE) combined with
fragmentation and dispersion for storage. This method is designed to protect data even if
both the key and the public fragment of EHR data on clouds are compromised. This aligns
with other research demonstrating that storing EHR in the cloud significantly enhances
security and protects patient information from unauthorized access [50].
4.5. Other Technologies
In addition to the technologies mentioned earlier, several studies have examined
methods that employ a variety of technologies to enhance the security and privacy of
medical data. Table 5 presents an overview of these technologies.

Protocol (HTTP) security methods. This solution provides secure hosting and operation
of application services, as well as the collection, storage, processing, and provisioning of
data. The results demonstrate that the adopted digital solution effectively protects APIs
and personal health data. Another study by Ref. [41] presents a new hash-based BBS
(HBBS) pseudo-random bit generator to ensure the integrity and security of data, making
it suitable for smart health applications and telemedicine. This study also proposes an
encryption technique aimed at achieving robust security during the transmission of medical
data. Furthermore, Ref. [44] introduces a secure and lightweight approach using fewer
elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) operations and a physically unclonable function (PUF),
improving security and efficiency with lower computational and communication costs. The
study by Ref. [45] proposes a privacy-preserving encryption approach that incorporates an
innovative data collection protocol. This method involves dividing patient data into three
parts and storing them across three data servers to maintain privacy.
Additionally, Ref. [46] designed several secure and privacy-preserving subprotocols
to ensure privacy in an e-healthcare system, adopting a secure greedy algorithm for query
performance and min-heap technology to enhance efficiency. The method in [47] offers an
architecture that improves the reliability of data exchange between healthcare personnel by
providing a security layer that supports accountability through context-aware services, en-
abling appropriate data access for users. Ref. [40] proposes a secure method for preserving
privacy in healthcare data, specifically for disease prediction in modern healthcare systems.
This system uses cryptography during data transfer and allows authorized healthcare staff
to securely access patient data for disease prediction using a herding genetic algorithm-
based deep learning neural network. Ref. [43] suggests a secure, expressive, and efficient
access control scheme with immediate attribute/user revocation in collaborative e-health
systems, based on the ordered binary decision diagram (OBDD) access structure. It binds
user keys to user identities, therefore creating resistance to collusion attacks. Additionally,
Ref. [39] highlights a model based on a multi-agent system comprising various intelligent
agents such as a user interface agent, authentication agent, connection establishment agent,
and connection management agent. This model provides effective and secure e-health
security services, facilitating ease of use and effective communication between users and
e-service providers.
Various studies have demonstrated the relationship between secure solutions for
storing and sharing sensitive health information and ensuring the security and privacy
of data in HISs. For instance, Ref. [42] proposed a secure scheme using a decentralized
federated learning-based convolutional neural network, private and public interplanetary
file systems (IPFS), a consortium blockchain network, and smart contracts. This scheme
Computers 2024, 13, 41

is ideal for promoting a secure and privacy-friendly environment for data sharing. In a
study by Ref. [49], a framework for 5G-secure smart healthcare monitoring (5GSS) was
employed for fast and accurate identification of context-aware health situations, along
with a blockchain-based secure data sharing mechanism and low-latency services for
emergent patients.
5. Discussion
In this systematic literature review, the articles on data privacy and security for HISs
that were reviewed focused on various technologies, such as the IoT, blockchain, mHealth
applications, and cloud computing. This section first discusses the challenges and future
directions of these technologies in relation to HISs. From this, three fundamentally distinct
security aspects could be identified, namely, secure access control, data sharing, and data
storage within HISs. These aspects will be discussed in the subsequent subsections.
5.1. Challenges and Future Directions of the Technologies Used in HISs
5.1.1. Mobile Health Applications
In the realm of mHealth applications, the privacy and security of medical data can be
significantly enhanced through the use of robust encryption techniques. These techniques
are crucial in preventing unauthorized access and are resistant to various attacks. Conse-
quently, even if unauthorized individuals gain access to the data, it remains indecipherable
without the appropriate decryption keys [7]. These findings are in line with those reported
in [51], which also emphasized the need for efficient measures to mitigate privacy and
security risks in mHealth. This highlights the significance of encryption in safeguarding
data against breaches.
A challenge identified in this review is the lack of adequate backup mechanisms
in many mHealth applications. Some applications do not have sufficient data backup
and recovery systems, which poses a challenge in restoring data following a security
breach or other data loss events. The article by Ref. [52] underscores the essential need
for comprehensive data backup and recovery mechanisms in mHealth applications and
points out the potential vulnerabilities in many current applications. This concern is echoed
in [53].
Therefore, the development of a framework for ensuring the privacy and security of
data in mHealth applications should encompass strategies aimed at minimizing risks. Such
strategies include employing strong encryption techniques to prevent unauthorized access,
implementing comprehensive data backup and recovery mechanisms, ensuring secure
storage, and maintaining clarity and ease of use for the end-user.
5.1.2. IoT
Many IoT devices used in healthcare are not designed with security as a primary
concern, and often feature weak password mechanisms or other vulnerabilities that are sus-
ceptible to exploitation by attackers [54]. Additionally, these devices and systems frequently
collect and transmit substantial amounts of personal and medical data, presenting risks
of unauthorized access, use, or disclosure [21,25]. This concern aligns with the findings of
Ref. [55], that underscore the necessity of a secure and resilient operating environment for
critical IoT systems in healthcare to mitigate potential threats. Consequently, addressing
these security vulnerabilities is imperative for the healthcare sector to ensure patient safety
and system integrity [56].
To bridge these gaps and overcome limitations, the healthcare sector should adopt
appropriate technical and organizational measures for data protection, implement effective
authentication mechanisms, and deploy security protocols alongside privacy-preserving
solutions for tracking, monitoring, and analytics. Furthermore, research that focuses on
designing IoT devices with standardized protocols to address the interoperability and
standardization challenges in IoT and healthcare systems is essential [57].
Computers 2024, 13, 41
19 of 25
5.1.3. Blockchain
Besides the significant benefits of using blockchain technology to control access to
sensitive medical information [58], achieving complete data privacy and confidentiality in
healthcare systems remains a considerable challenge that must be addressed effectively [49].
These findings align with Ref. [59], who suggests that blockchain-based health systems
must establish robust mechanisms to protect patient data and ensure privacy. Other
concerns include the scalability of blockchain technology and the management of shared
healthcare records, which can affect their capacity to ensure the security and privacy of
health information [60]. Additionally, the processing speed and capacity of blockchain
systems may not be sufficient for the demands of real-time healthcare data management [32],
which is a concern that was also raised in other studies [61,62].
Considering this, further research and development focusing on enhancing the scala-
bility and performance of blockchain networks, strengthening measures for data privacy
and confidentiality, addressing interoperability challenges, and considering the societal
and security implications of blockchain-based health systems, is required.
5.1.4. Cloud Computing
One of the findings of this review is the security concerns associated with cloud com-
puting. Cloud computing systems are vulnerable to hacking and data breaches, potentially
exposing sensitive medical information to unauthorized parties [35]. This concern aligns
with findings from Ref. [63], who indicate that healthcare organizations are hesitant to
adopt cloud computing due to concerns over patient information confidentiality, privacy,
and service costs. Ensuring the security of patient data and compliance with regulations
such as the HIPAA and GDPR remain a significant challenge in cloud-based HISs [64].
The potential exposure of sensitive health information and the need for robust backup
and disaster recovery mechanisms are significant areas of concern for healthcare organiza-
tions [63]. Medical institutions may have limited control over the security and privacy of
their data when utilizing cloud computing systems, and they often depend on the security
measures implemented by the cloud provider [17,37]. This finding is consistent with [64],
highlighting the challenges in maintaining control over data, which also encompasses
issues related to data interception and ownership in cloud computing.
Based on this analysis, while cloud computing offers numerous benefits for health-
care, such as improved collaboration, cost savings, and scalability, it also presents critical
limitations and challenges. Overcoming security concerns, ensuring data privacy and
confidentiality, and addressing the reluctance to adopt cloud technology are essential for
the successful implementation of cloud computing in healthcare. These are crucial issues
for future research. Furthermore, data protection methods should be designed to suit
real-world clinical settings [37].
5.2. Secure Access Control
Numerous articles have emphasized the importance of secure access control as a vital
component of HISs, regardless of the technology used. This is essential to ensuring the pri-
vacy and security of sensitive patient data. Secure access control is instrumental in prevent-
ing data breaches by regulating access to sensitive patient data. This approach effectively
reduces the risk of data theft, cyberattacks, and other security threats [21,30,35,39,41,43].
Moreover, it ensures that only authorized individuals can access sensitive patient informa-
tion, thereby protecting patient privacy and preventing unauthorized access to information
that can be exploited for malicious purposes [23,38–40,44]. Implementing secure access
controls is crucial in preventing data breaches, which can be both costly and damaging
to healthcare organizations. By restricting access to sensitive data, the likelihood of data
breaches can significantly be minimized. Most studies suggest that secure access control not
only reduces communication and computational costs but also enhances security [21,30,35].
From an efficiency standpoint, some articles highlight that certain systems are effective for
real-time healthcare systems [30,35,44], while others suggest that certain models, particu-
Computers 2024, 13, 41

larly those based on agent-based systems, provide effective and secure e-health security
services [39].
This study has identified secure access control as being critical for ensuring the privacy
and security of medical data. However, several challenges exist in implementing secure
access control in HISs. HISs typically involve multiple levels of access control, including
user authentication, authorization, and audit logging. Managing and configuring these
controls can be complex, with a risk of misconfiguration or loopholes that can lead to
security breaches. Additionally, HISs are often intricate and may involve various systems
handling large volumes of data and users. Consequently, integrating different systems and
ensuring that they all have the necessary access controls is challenging. Furthermore, there
are numerous regulations and standards, such as the HIPAA, HITECH, and GDPR, which
must be adhered to in the healthcare industry [10].
When integrating blockchain and cloud computing to facilitate decentralized access
control, healthcare organizations must adopt a comprehensive and proactive strategy for
securing access to HISs. This strategy may include implementing multi-factor authenti-
cation, encryption, and user training and awareness programs, along with conducting
regular security audits and assessments. Furthermore, healthcare organizations should
stay informed about the latest security best practices and emerging threats, adjusting their
access controls as necessary.
According to the literature, several limitations are associated with providing secure
access control. Technical limitations pertain to the technical infrastructure of HISs, such
as vulnerabilities in software or hardware, potentially compromising system security and
permitting unauthorized access to sensitive data. Human factors also pose a threat, as
employees might intentionally or unintentionally misuse sensitive patient data, leading to
data breaches or other security incidents.
Addressing the identified weaknesses in secure access control of HISs requires a mul-
tifaceted approach to effectively enhance security and protect sensitive patient data. A
key strategy is the strengthening of the technical infrastructure. This involves regular
updates and patches to both software and hardware components of HISs, which help
fix vulnerabilities and enhance a system’s overall security. Another crucial aspect is the
enhancement of employee training and awareness. Implementing comprehensive training
programs focused on data security and privacy practices increases employees’ awareness of
potential risks. This education is vital for reducing the likelihood of data breaches resulting
from human error or misuse. Further fortification of HIS security includes implementing
advanced authentication mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication. This significant
step, coupled with regular audits of access, will ensures that only authorized personnel
access sensitive patient data, thereby minimizing the risk of unauthorized breaches. Addi-
tionally, conducting regular system audits and security assessments is indispensable. These
periodic reviews assist in identifying and mitigating potential threats to HISs. Continu-
ous monitoring and assessment of the security landscape allow proactive addressing of
potential vulnerabilities. By focusing on these critical areas—upgrading technical infras-
tructure, enhancing employee awareness and training, implementing robust authentication
processes, and conducting regular security audits—the security of HISs can significantly be
improved. This comprehensive approach reduces the likelihood of unauthorized access
and strengthens the protection of patient data.
5.3. Secure Data Sharing
Another aspect of security discussed in the literature is the facilitation of secure data
sharing in HISs. One method for achieving secure data sharing involves utilizing decen-
tralized solutions [19,29,32–34]. Implementing lightweight and cost-effective mechanisms
can enhance efficiency by minimizing time and resource consumption, thereby reducing
expenses for healthcare organizations [24,29,46]. Other approaches offer secure data shar-
ing by enabling a centralized system, which is simpler to monitor and secure compared
to multiple disparate systems [16,17,20,21,33,35]. Studies, such as [33], demonstrate that
Computers 2024, 13, 41
21 of 25
secure and trustworthy data sharing empowers patients to manage their own data, includ-
ing having complete control over sharing permissions. Furthermore, Ref. [37] introduces
a data sharing system from a user-centric perspective, which not only improves medical
treatment but also safeguards individual safety and privacy.
Based on analysis, achieving secure data sharing in HISs is a complex and ongoing
process that demands constant vigilance. However, implementing robust authentication
and authorization mechanisms is challenging, particularly in large healthcare organizations
with multiple systems and databases. A further challenge arises from the fact that HISs
often operate across various technologies and standards, complicating data exchange
and potentially leading to incomplete patient records, thus hindering secure information
sharing. One significant challenge for healthcare organizations is to prevent data breaches,
which can lead to the theft or exposure of sensitive patient data. Protective measures may
include firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and other security protocols. Additionally,
HIS staff must be thoroughly trained and made aware of the importance of data privacy
and security. They should understand the risks associated with data breaches and be
educated on prevention strategies.
Previous studies on secure data sharing in HISs highlight its essential role in enhancing
patient care but also point out several limitations that must be addressed. A primary limita-
tion is the lack of interoperability, which hampers data sharing across different systems.
This can create barriers to secure health information sharing, leading to incomplete patient
records, especially when patients receive care from multiple providers or organizations.
Another critical limitation is the vulnerability of HISs to cybersecurity attacks and technical
failures due to their complex technical infrastructure. These incidents can compromise the
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive health information. Furthermore, reg-
ulatory and legal barriers can prevent data sharing between different healthcare providers
and organizations, limiting the benefits of data sharing in healthcare outcomes. Technical
constraints also pose significant challenges to secure data sharing. Some HISs may lack
the capacity for large-scale data sharing or the necessary security features to safeguard
data during transmission. Additionally, most schemes for secure data sharing are not
designed with real-world clinical settings in mind. Finally, the lack of standardization in
HISs can impede the accuracy and consistency of shared data, further complicating the
secure sharing process.
In response to the challenges encountered in secure data exchange within HISs, sev-
eral principal recommendations have been identified as best practices. First, there is an
increasing agreement on the need to enhance interoperability. This involves developing and
adopting standardized protocols and formats, which are essential for enabling smooth data
transfer across various HIS platforms. Equally critical is the strengthening of cybersecurity
measures. To protect HISs against cyber threats and technical mishaps, the implementation
of advanced security protocols is crucial. In conjunction, regular security audits and system
updates are necessary to ensure robust defenses against potential cyberattacks. Another
key aspect is addressing the regulatory and legal barriers that impede efficient data sharing.
A coordinated effort to harmonize regulations can facilitate data exchange across different
jurisdictions while ensuring secure and compliant operations. Improving the technical
infrastructure of HISs is also a priority. This includes upgrading systems to not only
support large-scale data sharing but also to integrate enhanced security features for data
protection. These upgrades are necessary to meet the growing demands and complexities
of modern healthcare data management. Additionally, the design of secure data sharing
systems should consider the practical needs and workflows of real-world clinical settings.
Customizing these systems to integrate seamlessly into the daily operations of healthcare
providers is essential for their effective adoption and use. Finally, the standardization of
data is vital. Promoting and implementing uniform standards in data recording and sharing
is crucial to ensuring accuracy and consistency across different systems. This uniformity is
key to improving the quality of patient care while maintaining the integrity and privacy of
health data.

5.4. Secure Data Storage
Various studies have discussed the importance of secure data storage in HISs for
ensuring data privacy and security. An analysis of these studies reveals that implementing
secure data storage can be cost-effective in the long run, as it reduces the risk of costly data
breaches for healthcare organizations [8,25]. Another significant finding is that utilizing
decentralized solutions helps address potential security issues through solidity-based smart
contracts [26,31,36]. It is also noted that secure data storage ensures patient data confi-
dentiality, allowing only authorized personnel access [7,18,41,45,48]. This practice helps
prevent data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive health information [20,28,31].
As indicated in the literature, secure data storage builds trust between patients and health-
care providers. Patients are more inclined to trust providers who take their data’s security
and privacy seriously, potentially leading to better patient outcomes and higher satisfac-
tion [17,22]. Additionally, secure data storage maintains the integrity of patient data by
preventing tampering or alteration, ensuring data accuracy and reliability, which is critical
for making important medical decisions [65]. Overall, secure data storage is essential for
maintaining patient data privacy and security, and healthcare organizations that prioritize
it can benefit from improved compliance, reduced costs, and increased trust.
In general, secure data storage in HISs requires a comprehensive approach that ad-
dresses key challenges to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of patient
data. This involves implementing stringent user authentication and authorization protocols,
ensuring that storage data are accessed only by authorized personnel. Furthermore, em-
ploying a multi-layered security approach that includes firewalls, encryption, and intrusion
detection systems can further strengthen data storage security against a wide array of
cyber threats. Maintaining the accuracy and completeness of patient data is critical for
effective patient care and medical decision-making, so utilizing reliable protocols for data
verification and validation can support data integrity. Additionally, implementing data
backup and recovery mechanisms can help mitigate the risk of data loss. Addressing these
recommendations will significantly improve the security and reliability of data storage
within HISs.
These improvements are not only beneficial for the protection of data but also play a
pivotal role in enhancing the overall quality of patient care.
6. Limitations

lished in English were included, thereby excluding articles reported in other languages.
Furthermore, the review was restricted to journal articles to ensure its quality. Conse-
quently, other types of publications, such as conference papers, books, white papers, and
organizational reports, were not considered. This exclusion may have resulted in missing
additional insights that could have been valuable for this review. Therefore, it is possible
that some security issues not mentioned in the selected articles were overlooked.
7. Conclusions
This study systematically reviews the literature on health information systems (HISs)
in relation to medical data privacy and security. It contributes to existing research by
identifying various related technologies and addressing security and privacy aspects. This
study highlights the necessity for a secure HIS that not only meets organizational objectives
but also ensures the protection of patient data. HISs offer significant benefits to healthcare
organizations in terms of storing, retrieving, analyzing, exchanging, and sharing patient
health information. These systems must both serve the needs of patients and health
practitioners, while safeguarding the security and privacy of medical data. Therefore, HISs
must be designed and implemented with privacy and security as primary considerations.
This involves employing secure technologies for data storage and sharing, enforcing access
controls to restrict data viewing or modification, and educating healthcare professionals on
best practices for patient data privacy and security.

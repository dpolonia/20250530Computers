Abstract: The aim of this study is to present, based on a systematic review of the literature, an
analysis of the impact of the application of the ChatGPT tool in education. The data were obtained
by reviewing the results of studies published since the launch of this application (November 2022)
in three leading scientiﬁc databases in the world of education (Web of Science, Scopus and Google
Scholar). The sample consisted of 12 studies. Using a descriptive and quantitative methodology, the
most signiﬁcant data are presented. The results show that the implementation of ChatGPT in the
educational environment has a positive impact on the teaching–learning process, however, the results
also highlight the importance of teachers being trained to use the tool properly. Although ChatGPT
can enhance the educational experience, its successful implementation requires teachers to be familiar
with its operation. These ﬁndings provide a solid basis for future research and decision-making
regarding the use of ChatGPT in the educational context.
Keywords: ChatGPT; artiﬁcial intelligence; education; impact; systematic review
1. Introduction
Over the past decades, artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) has experienced rapid growth and
has transformed many areas of society. AI has positioned itself at the forefront of research
ﬁelds ranging from medicine and robotics to education and autonomous driving. Broadly
speaking, artiﬁcial intelligence refers to the ability of a computer system to mimic the
behaviour of the human brain. This involves receiving information in the form of external
data, learning through training and based on that learning, achieving the goals for which it
was designed [1].
The implementation of artiﬁcial intelligence in education has had a signiﬁcant impact,
evidenced by improvements in the efﬁciency of the educational process, the promotion of
global learning, the personalisation of learning, the creation of more intelligent content and
the optimisation of educational management in terms of effectiveness and efﬁciency [2].
Nowadays, new technologies play a fundamental role in optimising the teaching–learning
process. Education is not limited to being a mere product but is a process in which learning
goes beyond the simple acquisition of knowledge. In this sense, artiﬁcial intelligence (AI)
emerges as a new technology with great potential in the ﬁeld of education, as AI-based
systems could foster personalised learning, adapting to the needs and interests of each
student [3].
Within education, it is critical to recognise that the implementation of AI raises signif-
icant challenges and ethical considerations. Issues such as data privacy, equity of access
to education and the impact on the role of the educator require careful attention. It is
essential to address these aspects in a responsible manner to ensure that AI is used in
a beneﬁcial and equitable way for all learners [4]. In this regard, it is critical to ﬁnd a

balance between technology and the essential role of educators to ensure that the focus
remains on the holistic development of students and their preparation for an ever-changing
world. Due to the short time between the launch of ChatGPT (end of November 2022),
no systematic reviews addressing its impact on education have been found [5]. Therefore,
the main objective of this systematic review is to analyse the existing literature on the use
of ChatGPT in education in order to identify its impact, beneﬁts, challenges and areas
of application in teaching and learning. In this regard, the following research questions
are addressed:
1.
What is the general state of scientiﬁc research on the use of ChatGPT in education?
2.
What are the beneﬁts and challenges of implementing ChatGPT in the classroom?
3.
What are the future trends and emerging research areas in the use of ChatGPT in
education?
2. Use of ChatGPT in Education
The use of ChatGPT in education has generated considerable interest due to its po-
tential to enrich the learning experience of students. By providing quick and personalised
responses, this system has the ability to address individual student needs, offer immediate
feedback and facilitate the understanding of complex concepts. In this way, it becomes a
promising tool that promotes a student’s active participation and cognitive advancement
by adapting to their learning pace and offering continuous support in their knowledge
acquisition process [6].
Following this line, it has proven to be a valuable tool to promote the development of
writing skills in students. By interacting with the system, students can receive grammatical
corrections, suggestions for improvement and detailed feedback on their writing, which
gives them the opportunity to improve their written communication and achieve greater
effectiveness in their written expression [7]. Thus, this application presents itself as an
invaluable assistance tool for scientiﬁc writing; however, it is essential to understand that
it should not be considered as a complete solution for scientiﬁc content creation. Writers
must exercise their knowledge and experience to validate and complement the information
provided by the tool. However, it also excels in its ability to facilitate group discussions
and promote collaborative student participation in projects and assignments. This fosters a
sense of community among learners by allowing interaction and an exchange of ideas [8].
Several studies have tried to explore the potential impact of artiﬁcial intelligence,
especially with the famous ChatGPT tool for students in education. Various applications of
artiﬁcial intelligence in education were studied, such as personalised learning experiences,
adaptive testing, predictive analytics and chatbots. As a result, it shows an incredible
potential to improve learning efﬁciency and provide personalised educational support to
both students and teachers. However, it is essential to consider the risks and limitations
associated with these technologies, such as data privacy, cultural differences, language
proﬁciency and associated ethical implications [9].
Its inﬂuence over the last year has sparked a growing interest in education. This
innovative tool has positioned itself as a disruptive technology that is revolutionising the
way students are taught, promoted, and supported in academic environments. In this sense,
educational centres are rethinking how to incorporate this technology into their didactic
models in order to improve the teaching and learning process of educational agents [10].
Therefore, teachers must approach this tool in the classroom and present it as an additional
resource that complements the learning process. However, it is crucial to highlight that
this tool does not replace the cognitive processes necessary in learning or other sources of
information such as books, articles or interactions with others.
3. Method
Following an explicit and systematic search strategy, with inclusion and exclusion
criteria, a systematic review of the literature will be carried out. For this, the researchers
have followed the recommendations of the PRISMA Statement [11].
Computers 2023, 12, 153

3.1. Search Strategy
The selected databases were Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar. The search
string (Table 1) was applied in the three international databases in the ﬁeld of education, in
the ﬁelds of title, abstract and/or keywords. The literature search was conducted between
May and June 2023, with an initial identiﬁcation of 154 records.

3.2. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
After eliminating duplicate studies (n = 73), the inclusion and exclusion criteria were
established to ensure that the selected studies were relevant and met the objectives of the
review (Table 2). These criteria were applied independently by two reviewers to ensure
objectivity and to minimise bias in the selection of studies. It was decided to limit the
search to articles published from the year 2022 onwards, as this was the year in which this
artiﬁcial intelligence chatbot developed by OpenIA was launched.

3.3. Methodological Quality Assessment
The Johanna Briggs Checklist (JBI) is a tool used to assess the methodological quality
of research studies. It consists of a set of criteria used to determine the rigour and validity of
a study. When applying the JBI checklist, aspects such as study design, participant selection,
data collection and analysis, among others, are analysed. The 14 identiﬁed articles were
assessed for their methodological quality. The included studies were examined through a
critical and independent review using an eleven-point checklist developed by Aromataris
and Munn [12].
To ensure an unbiased assessment, a masked review of the checklist was conducted
by two independent researchers, unrelated to the study. This measure was implemented
to avoid any assessment bias on the part of the study authors themselves. The selected
studies had to meet at least four of the checklist criteria. The checklist used covered the
following assessment criteria:
-
Is the purpose of the research clearly speciﬁed?
-
Does it address the use and impact of ChatGPT in education?
-
Are the data extraction instruments appropriate?
-
Are the results obtained useful to the research community?
-
Are the authors’ conclusions supported by the data analysed?
-
Are recommendations made for future research?
Computers 2023, 12, 153
4 of 13
Two studies [7,13] were excluded based on the quality issues raised in the checklist, as
they did not meet at least four of the criteria provided above.
3.4. Selection of Studies
A total of 154 records were identiﬁed in the three electronic databases analysed. After
removing duplicate records (n = 73), studies were reviewed by title and abstracts to assess
eligibility (n = 81). A total of 67 studies were excluded as they did not meet the established
inclusion and exclusion criteria. Subsequently, the remaining 14 studies were assessed for
methodological quality, eliminating 2 studies. Finally, a total of 12 studies were eligible for
inclusion in the review. Figure 1 shows the ﬂow chart of the record selection process based
on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)
guidelines [11].

3.5. Data Extraction and Analysis
In order to address the research questions posed previously, we carried out a content
analysis combining qualitative and quantitative approaches to the 12 research studies
obtained. The quantitative analysis allowed us to visualise and understand general aspects
of the topic through descriptive graphs. For the qualitative analysis, we used the VOSviewer
1.6.15. tool to identify the main trends and scientiﬁc impact of the research ﬁeld [14,15].
Each of these clusters has a different number of elements, colour, and size. The size is
determined by the frequency of occurrence. The larger the circle, the more frequently that
keyword is used in the studies [16]. The main characteristics of the studies included in the
review related to ChatGPT in education are provided in Table 3.

4. Results
Once the studies related to the impact of ChatGPT application in education were
collected, a total of 12 relevant articles were selected for this systematic review. When
observing the distribution of the collected research according to the year of publication,
it is evident that all the articles found belong to the year 2023. This is due to the fact that
the implementation of ChatGPT in education was implemented at the end of 2022, which
did not allow enough time for studies to be conducted and articles on its impact to be
published until the following year. Looking at the distribution of the studies according
to the place of publication, research from the Asian continent predominates with 66.67%
of the research collected, coming from countries such as the United Arab Emirates, Qatar,
Indonesia, Turkey, India and Bangladesh. However, we also found research from the
Americas (25%) and Europe (8.33%) to a lesser extent. Some of these countries are Spain,
Mexico, Poland and Cuba. No articles were found from the African or Oceanic continent
(Figure 2).

Figure 2. Distribution of studies by population location.
Regarding the methodology used in the selected articles, it is worth noting that most of
the research published on the impact of ChatGPT in the educational ﬁeld has been carried
out through a theoretical approach (50%), with the aim of understanding the potential
and challenges of this tool. To a lesser extent, there are other studies that have chosen to
approach the study from both a qualitative and quantitative methodology (25%) (Figure 3).
Figure 3. Distribution of studies by methodology used.
Considering the main ﬁndings that were found after reading the selected articles,
Figure 4 shows that the main result obtained was that the use of ChatGPT in education
is a great educational support in the teaching and learning process for both students and
teachers (82%). This is closely linked to the improvement of performance, motivation,
organization and efﬁcient time management, as well as the promotion of a more effective
and collaborative learning environment. At the same time, there is a lack of teacher train-
ing regarding the use of ChatGPT for its subsequent application and use in educational
Computers 2023, 12, 153
8 of 13
classrooms (58%), as many teachers do not have the necessary skills to apply it efﬁciently.
However, it is necessary that all educational agents know how to use this tool in a responsi-
ble way, following ethical guidelines, since inappropriate use could be an obstacle in the
learning process of students (52%). On the other hand, and closely related to the previous
ﬁnding, a large part of the research collected in their articles shows the great changes at the
educational level that the use of ChatGPT can create by generating a strong impact on the
way of teaching and carrying out tasks (46%). Lastly, the articles reﬂect a concern for the
clear need for student training (32%) and the possible problems in the educational system
that can be generated after prolonged use of this application (28%).
Figure 4. Main ﬁndings of the analysed studies.
Finally, to ﬁnd out the lines of research in this ﬁeld, three clusters were obtained from
the mapping of VOSviewer. The three clusters obtained are (Figure 5):
Figure 5. Labelled bibliometric map.

-
Cluster 1 (red). The cluster marked in red has 19 items, including application, artiﬁcial
intelligence, challenge, ChatGPT, critical thinking, education, future, impact, implica-
tion, limitation, need, opportunity, research, strategy, teacher, teaching, technology,
tool and use. This cluster is therefore linked to research on the role of the teacher in
an educational environment driven by artiﬁcial intelligence, including their training,
the impact of using artiﬁcial intelligence tools and their adaptation to changes in their
pedagogical practice.
-
Cluster 2 (blue). The cluster marked in blue has 18 items, including approach, chatbot,
chatbot technology, class, context, data, development, experiment, feedback, inter-
action, knowledge, learning, participant, performance, problem, skills, student and
study. This cluster is related to the line of research on the use of chatbots in education,
including their impact on students.
-
Cluster 3 (green). The cluster marked in green has 18 items, including accuracy, analy-
sis, answer, conversation, conversational agent, ﬁeld, higher education, information,
model, order, paper, question, response, system, time, university, user and work. This
cluster is related to research on the impact of the chatbot on teaching and learning
processes, including factors such as the socioeconomic, cultural, institutional and
technological environment in which it is developed.
5. Discussion
To address the research questions posed in the study, the ﬁndings obtained through
the qualitative and quantitative content analysis conducted in the 12 selected research will
be explored.
Q1: What is the general state of scientiﬁc research on the use of ChatGPT in education?
The general state of scientiﬁc research on the use of ChatGPT in education is limited
due to the recent implementation of this application in the educational setting, being still in
its initial stages. A total of 12 relevant articles were collected for a systematic review, all
published in the year 2023. This is because the use of ChatGPT in the educational setting is
a relatively new practice, since its launch occurred at the end of 2022, so there has not been
enough time to conduct long-term studies and collect meaningful data on the impact on
education until the ﬁrst months of the following year [26].
In terms of geographic focus, a greater representation of studies belonging to the
Asian continent was observed. The predominance of research from Asian countries may be
related to the early adoption of technology in these regions and their focus on educational
research. Other factors such as the availability of research funds and collaboration between
university institutions may also inﬂuence these data. It should also be noted that in different
countries, the use of this tool has been banned in educational centres [25].
In relation to the methodology used in the selected articles on the impact of ChatGPT
in education, a high predominance of theoretical articles stands out, as opposed to qual-
itative and/or quantitative studies. This may be possible because the development and
implementation of artiﬁcial intelligence technologies in education, such as ChatGPT, are
still at a relatively early stage, so the exploration of the possibilities and challenges presents
a mainly theoretical approach before conducting empirical research [10].
Q2: What are the beneﬁts and challenges of implementing ChatGPT in the classroom?
In an ever-changing society, technological advancement has taken on a fundamental
role in our existence and, naturally, it has left its mark on the ﬁeld of education. OpenAI’s
innovative creation, known as ChatGPT, is revolutionising the way educators and students
approach the learning process in the classroom. The implementation of ChatGPT in schools
brings a number of beneﬁts and challenges that educational agents need to be aware of in
order to improve the quality of education in the classroom.
Its use in the classroom is offered as a promising tool that offers multiple beneﬁts
for learning. This tool allows content and activities to be customised to the speciﬁc needs
Computers 2023, 12, 153
10 of 13
of each student, improving the effectiveness of teaching and learning. In other words,
it allows students to adapt to their learning pace and provides constant support in their
knowledge acquisition process.
All of this results in having more individualised and personalised learning, which
leads to an improvement in motivation and commitment on the part of students, being
considered as a fundamental educational support for the improvement of the teaching and
learning process [6]. At the same time, ChatGPT promotes collaboration by allowing stu-
dents to work together to research topics and develop communication and teamwork skills,
leveraging this tool to support the educational process. ChatGPT is also an easy-to-use and
accessible tool for teachers and students, allowing for quick integration into the classroom.
Finally, by providing support in the generation of content and activities, ChatGPT allows
teachers to focus on more important aspects of teaching, such as personalised interaction
and feedback.
However, for an effective implementation of this tool, the importance of providing
training appropriate to the current context is highlighted. Teachers must be provided
with the necessary technological knowledge to be able to use this tool effectively in the
educational environment, preventing teachers themselves from being an obstacle in the
implementation of this tool. In this sense, teachers must not only learn how to use the
technology itself but also understand its possibilities and limitations, as well as address the
associated ethical and pedagogical challenges [10]. Along these lines, the implementation
of this tool should be approached in a reﬂective manner to ensure a responsible classroom
environment. Its use in the education system must be carefully evaluated to ensure that it is
not used to that it is not used to replace these important skills [26]. However, there is a need
to consider the academic misuse of ChatGPT that may be implied by using text generation
technology for dishonest or unethical purposes in academia [19]. In addition, ChatGPT’s
knowledge is still limited and has not yet been updated with information beyond 2021 [27].
Therefore, its answers may not always be accurate or reliable, especially on specialised
topics and recent events. In addition, ChatGPT may generate incorrect or even inaccurate
information [28]. This situation can pose a challenge for students who rely on ChatGPT for
information during their learning process. In this context, one of these speciﬁc limitations
is the phenomenon known as “hallucinations”. In the context of chatbots such as ChatGPT,
hallucinations refer to responses that sound plausible but are incorrect or nonsensical. That
is, the chatbot may generate responses that appear to be well-written and coherent but are
actually erroneous or unsubstantiated information. This phenomenon can be problematic
in the educational context since students could receive incorrect or confusing information,
which would negatively affect their learning and understanding of the topics. This is why
it is important to take these limitations into account and carefully evaluate the accuracy
and reliability of the chatbot before using it as an educational tool [29].
Q3: What are the future trends and emerging research areas in the use of ChatGPT
in education?
After conducting an analysis using the VOSviewer software, a bibliometric analysis
was performed to visualise research trends in relation to the use of ChatGPT in education.
This analysis revealed three clusters grouping the keywords present in the titles and
abstracts of the studies found in the databases, allowing us to identify three main emerging
research areas and the directions that the research in this ﬁeld is taking.
The ﬁrst is focused entirely on the role of the teacher in the educational setting driven
by the use of artiﬁcial intelligence. The role of the teacher in the context of the use of artiﬁ-
cial intelligence is crucial for improving educational practice and fostering new teaching
methodologies [23]. ChatGPT is a valuable tool for trainers, providing them with a starting
point for designing curricula, teaching materials and assessment activities [30].
The second line of research in the ﬁeld of education focuses on the impact and use
of artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) in the classroom, which has aroused great interest among
educators and pedagogical experts. The incorporation of artiﬁcial intelligence as a com-
Computers 2023, 12, 153
11 of 13
plementary tool in the teaching–learning process has shown promise and has generated a
variety of research [20]. In this context, artiﬁcial intelligence, and in particular ChatGPT,
has been highlighted for its ability to improve a student’s academic performance and foster
the development of critical thinking. By providing quick and accurate answers to speciﬁc
questions, ChatGPT facilitates access to relevant and up-to-date information, which can
be particularly beneﬁcial for students in their process of inquiry and understanding of
different topics [22]. In addition, artiﬁcial intelligence adapts to each student’s individual
learning pace, allowing them to progress at their own pace and receive personalised sup-
port based on their needs. This not only improves student motivation and engagement but
also frees up time for educators to focus on more interactive and creative tasks, such as
one-to-one tutoring and constructive feedback [21]. However, it is also important to bear in
mind some challenges and ethical considerations when incorporating artiﬁcial intelligence
in the classroom. For example, it is essential to ensure the privacy and security of student
data, as well as to assess the accuracy and reliability of the answers provided by AI to avoid
the spread of erroneous or biased information [20].
The last line is closely related to the impact of artiﬁcial intelligence on teaching and
learning processes, including factors such as the socioeconomic, cultural, institutional
and technological environment [19]. In summary, AI technologies such as ChatGPT can
help educational institutions achieve intelligent management and allocation of learning
resources, improve the utilisation and effectiveness of educational resources, greatly change
the shape of education quality and efﬁciency, provide better learning services to students
and help them to better adapt to the development needs of future society.
6. Conclusions
The systematic literature review has shown that scientiﬁc research on the use of the
ChatGPT tool in education is still scarce, as it turns out to be a novel tool launched in late
2022. The use of ChatGPT in education has emerged as an innovative and promising tool
that seeks to enhance the learning experience and foster greater interaction between stu-
dents and teachers. As its possibilities are investigated and understood, the use of ChatGPT
in education reveals a signiﬁcant potential to transform teaching and learning methods.
In this sense, this artiﬁcial intelligence tool proves to be a motivating tool for students, by
having to apply Information and Communication Technologies, and signiﬁcantly improves
students’ academic performances, if it is used appropriately. However, it is essential to bear
in mind that its use presents a series of challenges, which teachers must be aware of to avoid
incorrect use. Along these lines, proper training of teachers and students can be effective to
know how to use the application and avoid its misuse in the academic environment. With
ethical implementation and proper supervision, this technology can open new educational
possibilities and enrich the teaching and learning process.
In this sense, although artiﬁcial intelligence is not something new, the emergence
of ChatGPT has generated debate in education, questioning aspects such as traditional
tasks, methodology and evaluation. Therefore, it is important to continue researching the
potential of these tools and their impact, considering didactic and scientiﬁc aspects, and
promoting an ethical and responsible integration of artiﬁcial intelligence in education.
The main limitation of this review lies in the limited amount of literature included
in the analysis. This is because, so far, not enough studies that address the speciﬁc use of
ChatGPT in higher education institutions have been conducted. Educational technology,
such as ChatGPT, is a constantly developing and evolving ﬁeld, and its implementation
in higher education may be relatively new and therefore less researched compared to
other levels of education. Despite this limitation, the review provides an overview of
how ChatGPT has inﬂuenced the university level. As more research is conducted and
knowledge about the use of ChatGPT in higher education expands, it will be useful to
expand the study to gain a more complete understanding of its impact and beneﬁts at
this speciﬁc educational level. In future studies, other databases such as ERIC or Dialnet,
Computers 2023, 12, 153

among others, could be included to ensure an exhaustive and comprehensive search for
relevant studies.

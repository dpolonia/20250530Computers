 abstract = {Generative AI is revolutionizing the way organizations operate, offering transformative capabilities that span automated content creation, strategic decision-making, and customer engagement through AI-driven chatbots. This paper conducts a comprehensive literature review to explore the applications, challenges, and strategic requirements for adopting generative AI in organizational contexts, focusing on the distinct needs of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and large organizations. The findings reveal that generative AI can improve efficiency, drive innovation, and improve customer satisfaction, but its adoption pathways differ significantly between organizational sizes. For SMEs, the emphasis lies on cost-effective and scalable solutions that optimize resource-constrained operations. At the same time, large organizations leverage their extensive resources to scale AI applications, manage complex systems, and address ethical and regulatory challenges. The study highlights critical barriers, including data privacy concerns, integration with legacy systems, and resistance to change, alongside actionable recommendations for overcoming these challenges. By synthesizing insights from 38 high-quality studies, this research bridges the gap between theory and practice. It provides a roadmap for organizations of varying scales to harness generative AI as a cornerstone of their digital transformation journey. It also identifies key areas for future exploration, ensuring relevance in this rapidly evolving field. © 2025 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.. All rights reserved.},

@article{ali_cybercrime_2025,
 abstract = {Technological advancements have helped all sectors to evolve. This advancement has widened the cyberspace and attack surface, which has led to a drastic increase in cyberattacks. Cybersecurity solutions have also evolved. The advancement is relatively slower in developing countries. However, the financial sector in developing countries has shown resistance to cyberattacks. This paper investigates the reasons for this resistance. Despite using legacy systems, the banking sector in Pakistan has demonstrated resistance to cyberattacks. The research used a qualitative approach. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with nine cybersecurity experts in the banking sector to illustrate the reasons for this cybersecurity resistance. The research focused on cybersecurity experts in the banking sector, recognizing that this industry is particularly prone to cyberattacks on a global scale. The study utilised a thematic analysis technique to find resistance factors. The analysis suggests that the opportunity cost of cyberattacks and lower attack surface in developing countries like Pakistan are the main reasons for the lower financial losses. The findings of this research will encourage the adoption of advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) for cybersecurity in developing countries’ banking and financial sectors.},

@article{aslam_interface_2020,
 abstract = {High-tech companies are struggling today with the maintenance of legacy software. Legacy software is vital to many organizations as it contains the important business logic. To facilitate maintenance of legacy software, a comprehensive understanding of the software’s behavior is essential. In terms of component-based software engineering, it is necessary to completely understand the behavior of components in relation to their interfaces, i.e., their interface protocols, and to preserve this behavior during the maintenance activities of the components. For this purpose, we present an approach to infer the interface protocols of software components from the behavioral models of those components, learned by a blackbox technique called active (automata) learning. To validate the learned results, we applied our approach to the software components developed with model-based engineering so that equivalence can be checked between the learned models and the reference models, ensuring the behavioral relations are preserved. Experimenting with components having reference models and performing equivalence checking builds confidence that applying active learning technique to reverse engineer legacy software components, for which no reference models are available, will also yield correct results. To apply our approach in practice, we present an automated framework for conducting active learning on a large set of components and deriving their interface protocols. Using the framework, we validated our methodology by applying active learning on 202 industrial software components, out of which, interface protocols could be successfully derived for 156 components within our given time bound of 1 h for each component. © 2020, The Author(s).},

@article{bhumichai_convergence_2024,
 abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology have emerged as increasingly prevalent and influential elements shaping global trends in Information and Communications Technology (ICT). Namely, the synergistic combination of blockchain and AI introduces beneficial, unique features with the potential to enhance the performance and efficiency of existing ICT systems. However, presently, the confluence of these two disruptive technologies remains in a rather nascent stage, undergoing continuous exploration and study. In this context, the work at hand offers insight regarding the most significant features of the AI and blockchain intersection. Sixteen outstanding, recent articles exploring the combination of AI and blockchain technology have been systematically selected and thoroughly investigated. From them, fourteen key features have been extracted, including data security and privacy, data encryption, data sharing, decentralized intelligent systems, efficiency, automated decision systems, collective decision making, scalability, system security, transparency, sustainability, device cooperation, and mining hardware design. Moreover, drawing upon the related literature stemming from major digital databases, we constructed a timeline of this technological convergence comprising three eras: emerging, convergence, and application. For the convergence era, we categorized the pertinent features into three primary groups: data manipulation, potential applicability to legacy systems, and hardware issues. For the application era, we elaborate on the impact of this technology fusion from the perspective of five distinct focus areas, from Internet of Things applications and cybersecurity, to finance, energy, and smart cities. This multifaceted, but succinct analysis is instrumental in delineating the timeline of AI and blockchain convergence and pinpointing the unique characteristics inherent in their integration. The paper culminates by highlighting the prevailing challenges and unresolved questions in blockchain and AI-based systems, thereby charting potential avenues for future scholarly inquiry. © 2024 by the authors.},

This article presents a lightweight artifact for eliciting scalability requirements during agile software development: the ScrumScale model. The ScrumScale model is a simple spreadsheet. The scalability concepts underlying the ScrumScale model are clarified in this design science research, which also utilizes coordination theory. This paper describes the open banking case study, in which a legacy banking system becomes open. This challenges the scalability of this legacy system. The first step in understanding this challenge is to elicit the new scalability requirements. In the open banking case study, key stakeholders from TietoEVRY spent 55 h eliciting the scalability requirements of TietoEVRY's open banking project. According to TietoEVRY, the ScrumScale model provided a systematic way of producing scalability requirements. For TietoEVRY, the scalability concepts behind the ScrumScale model also offered significant advantages in dialogs with other stakeholders. © 2021 The Authors},

It is a common practice for every organization to adopt the latest technology to gain or sustain their competitive advantage against competitors. Nevertheless, not every technology implemented in banks is a state of the art technology. They come from a different extent, and these older generation technologies are called the legacy system. The mainframe is usually a part of a legacy system because it exists since the organization was established. The mainframe managed a humongous financial transaction at a time. Its reliable performance makes it indispensable. Therefore, banks are facing the interoperability challenges between the legacy system and new technologies. This study will analyze the approach used by a bank in Indonesia in embracing agile development principles in implementing new technologies above their rigid legacy infrastructure.},

@article{cazzola_software_2024,
 abstract = {Legacy software poses a critical challenge for organizations due to the costs of maintaining and modernizing outdated systems, as well as the scarcity of experts in aging programming languages. The issue extends beyond commercial applications, affecting public administration, as exemplified by the urgent need for COBOL programmers during the COVID-19 pandemic. In response, this work introduces a modernization approach based on dynamic language product lines, a subset of dynamic software product lines. This approach leverages open language implementations and dynamically generated micro-languages for the incremental migration of legacy systems to modern technologies. The language can be reconfigured at runtime to adapt to the execution of either legacy or modern code, and to generate a compatibility layer between the data types handled by the two languages. Through this process, the costs of modernizing legacy systems can be spread across several iterations, as developers can replace legacy code incrementally, with legacy and modern code coexisting until a complete refactoring is possible. By moving the overhead of making legacy and modern features work together in a hybrid system from the system implementation to the language implementation, the quality of the system itself does not degrade due to the introduction of glue code. To demonstrate the practical applicability of this approach, we present a case study on a COBOL system migration to Java. Using the Neverlang language workbench to create modular and reconfigurable language implementations, both the COBOL interpreter and the application evolve to spread the development effort across several iterations. Through this study, this work presents a viable solution for organizations dealing with the complexity of modernizing legacy software to contemporary technologies. The contributions of this work are (i) a language-oriented, incremental refactoring process for legacy systems, (ii) a concrete application of open language implementations, and (iii) a general template for the implementation of interoperability between languages in hybrid systems.},

These environments present distinct challenges, including a limited communication bandwidth, energy constraints, and secure data handling needs. Enhancing BIoT systems requires a strategic selection of computing paradigms, such as edge and fog computing, and lightweight nodes to reduce latency and improve data processing in resource-limited settings. While a blockchain can improve data integrity and security, it can also introduce complexities, including interoperability issues, high energy consumption, standardization challenges, and costly transitions from legacy systems. The solutions reviewed here include lightweight consensus mechanisms to reduce computational demands. They also utilize established platforms, such as Ethereum and Hyperledger, or custom blockchains designed to meet marine-specific requirements. Additional approaches incorporate technologies such as fog and edge layers, software-defined networking (SDN), the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) for decentralized storage, and AI-enhanced security measures, all adapted to each application’s needs. Future research will need to prioritize scalability, energy efficiency, and interoperability for effective BIoT deployment.},

 abstract = {Driven by the ongoing migration towards Industry 4.0, the increasing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) has empowered smart manufacturing and digital transformation. AI enhances the migration towards industry 4.0 through AI-based decision-making by analyzing real-time data to optimize different processes such as production planning, predictive maintenance, quality control etc., thus guaranteeing reduced costs, high precision, efficiency and accuracy. This paper explores AI-driven smart manufacturing, revolutionizing traditional approaches and unlocking new possibilities throughout the major phases of the industrial equipment lifecycle. Through a comprehensive review, we delve into a wide range of AI techniques employed to tackle challenges such as optimizing process control, machining parameters, facilitating decision-making, and elevating maintenance strategies within the major phases of an industrial equipment lifecycle. These phases encompass design, manufacturing, maintenance, and recycling/retrofitting. As reported in the 2022 McKinsey Global Survey (https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai-in-2022-and-a-half-decade-in-review), the adoption of AI has witnessed more than a two-fold increase since 2017. This has contributed to an increase in AI research within the last six years. Therefore, from a meticulous search of relevant electronic databases, we carefully selected and synthesized 42 articles spanning from 01 January 2017 to 20 May 2023 to highlight and review the most recent research, adhering to specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, and shedding light on the latest trends and popular AI techniques adopted by researchers. This includes AI techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), Bayesian Networks, Support Vector Machines (SVM) etc., which are extensively discussed in this paper. Additionally, we provide insights into the advantages (e.g., enhanced decision making) and challenges (e.g., AI integration with legacy systems due to technical complexities and compatibilities) of integrating AI across the major stages of industrial equipment operations. Strategically implementing AI techniques in each phase enables industries to achieve enhanced productivity, improved product quality, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability. This exploration of the potential of AI in smart manufacturing fosters agile and resilient processes, keeping industries at the forefront of technological advancements and harnessing the full potential of AI-driven solutions to improve manufacturing processes and products. © The Author(s) 2023.},

 abstract = {Cloud computing is an emerging technology paradigm that migrates current technological and computing concepts into utility-like solutions similar to electricity and water systems. Clouds bring out a wide range of benefits including configurable computing resources, economic savings, and service flexibility. However, security and privacy concerns are shown to be the primary obstacles to a wide adoption of clouds. The new concepts that clouds introduce, such as multi-tenancy, resource sharing and outsourcing, create new challenges to the security community. Addressing these challenges requires, in addition to the ability to cultivate and tune the security measures developed for traditional computing systems, proposing new security policies, models, and protocols to address the unique cloud security challenges. In this work, we provide a comprehensive study of cloud computing security and privacy concerns. We identify cloud vulnerabilities, classify known security threats and attacks, and present the state-of-the-art practices to control the vulnerabilities, neutralize the threats, and calibrate the attacks. Additionally, we investigate and identify the limitations of the current solutions and provide insights of the future security perspectives. Finally, we provide a cloud security framework in which we present the various lines of defense and identify the dependency levels among them. We identify 28 cloud security threats which we classify into five categories. We also present nine general cloud attacks along with various attack incidents, and provide effectiveness analysis of the proposed countermeasures. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

 abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a cornerstone of modern technology, revolutionizing industries from healthcare to finance. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a subset of AI that have emerged as a powerful tool for various tasks including image recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing (NLP), and even in the field of genomics, where they have been utilized to classify DNA sequences. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of CNNs and their applications in image recognition tasks. It first introduces the fundamentals of CNNs, including the layers of CNNs, convolution operation (Conv\_Op), Feat\_Maps, activation functions (Activ\_Func), and training methods. It then discusses several popular CNN architectures such as LeNet, AlexNet, VGG, ResNet, and InceptionNet, and compares their performance. It also examines when to use CNNs, their advantages and limitations, and provides recommendations for developers and data scientists, including preprocessing the data, choosing appropriate hyperparameters (Hyper\_Param), and evaluating model performance. It further explores the existing platforms and libraries for CNNs such as TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, Caffe, and MXNet, and compares their features and functionalities. Moreover, it estimates the cost of using CNNs and discusses potential cost-saving strategies. Finally, it reviews recent developments in CNNs, including attention mechanisms, capsule networks, transfer learning, adversarial training, quantization and compression, and enhancing the reliability and efficiency of CNNs through formal methods. The paper is concluded by summarizing the key takeaways and discussing the future directions of CNN research and development. © 2023 by the author.},

 abstract = {In a previous paper we defined testFAILS, a set of benchmarks for measuring the efficacy of Large Language Models in various domains. This paper defines a second-generation framework, testFAILS-2 to measure how current AI engines are progressing towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). The testFAILS-2 framework offers enhanced evaluation metrics that address the latest developments in Artificial Intelligence Linguistic Systems (AILS). A key feature of this re-view is the “Chat with Alan” project, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based AI bot inspired by Alan Turing, designed to distinguish between human and AI generated interactions, thereby emulating Turing’s original vision. We assess a variety of models, including ChatGPT-4o-mini and other Small Language Models (SLMs), as well as prominent Large Language Models (LLMs), utilizing expanded criteria that encompass result relevance, accessibility, cost, multimodality, agent creation capabilities, emotional AI attributes, AI search capacity, and LLM-robot integration. The analysis reveals that testFAILS-2 significantly enhances the evaluation of model robustness and user productivity, while also identifying critical areas for improvement in multimodal processing and emotional reasoning. By integrating rigorous evaluation standards and novel testing methodologies, testFAILS-2 advances the assessment of AILS, providing essential insights that contribute to the ongoing development of more effective and resilient AI systems towards achieving AGI.},

@article{mateus_learning_2023,
 abstract = {Context: A Legacy system can be defined as a system that significantly resists modification and evolution. According to the literature, there are two main strategies to migrate a legacy system: (a) to replace the legacy system by a new one, (b) to incrementally migrate parts from the legacy system to the new one. Incremental migration allows developers to better control the risks that may occur during the migration process. However, this strategy is more complex because it requires decomposition of the legacy system into different parts, e.g. a set of files, and to define the order of migration of them along the migration process. To our knowledge, there is no approach to support developers on those activities. Objective: This paper presents an approach, named MigrationExp, to support incremental language migrations of applications from one source language to another target language. MigrationExp recommends the files that should be migrated first in a particular migration iteration. As a novelty, our approach relies on a ranking model learned, using a learning-to-rank algorithm, from migrations made by developers. Method: We validate our approach in the context of the migrations of Android apps, from Java to Kotlin, a new official language for Android. We train our model using migrations of Java code to Kotlin written by developers on open-source applications. Results: The results show that, on the task of proposing files to migrate, our approach outperforms a previous migration strategy proposed by Google, in terms of its ability to accurately predict empirically observed migration orders. Conclusion: Since most Android applications are written in Java, we conclude that approaches to support developers such as MigrationExp may significantly impact the development of Android applications.},

The results show that participants vary in their trust across domains. Notably, AI systems’ abilities were evaluated higher than their benevolence across all domains. Demographic traits had less influence on trust in AI abilities and benevolence compared to technology-related factors. Specifically, participants with greater technological competence, AI familiarity, and knowledge viewed AI as more capable in all domains.

 abstract = {The building sector is responsible for a significant amount of energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Thus, the monitoring, control and optimization of energy consumption in buildings will play a critical role in the coming years in improving energy efficiency in the building sector and in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, while there are a significant number of studies on how to make buildings smarter and manage energy through smart devices, there is a need for more research on integrating buildings with legacy equipment and systems. It is therefore vital to define mechanisms to improve the use of energy efficiency in existing buildings. This study proposes a new architecture (PHOENIX architecture) for integrating legacy building systems into scalable energy management systems with focus also on user comfort in the concept of interoperability layers. This interoperable and intelligent architecture relies on Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to increase building efficiency, grid flexibility and occupant well-being. To validate the architecture and demonstrate the impact and replication potential of the proposed solution, five demonstration pilots have been utilized across Europe. As a result, by implementing the proposed architecture in the pilot sites, 30 apartments and four commercial buildings with more than 400 devices have been integrated into the architecture and have been communicating successfully. In addition, six Trials were performed in a commercial building and five key performance indicators (KPIs) were measured in order to evaluate the robust operation of the architecture. Work is still ongoing for the trials and the KPIs’ analysis after the implementation of PHOENIX architecture at the rest of the pilot sites. © 2022 by the authors.},

 abstract = {Systematic reviews aide the analysis and dissemination of evidence, using rigorous and transparent methods to generate empirically attained answers to focused research questions. Identifying all evidence relevant to the research questions is an essential component, and challenge, of systematic reviews. Gray literature, or evidence not published in commercial publications, can make important contributions to a systematic review. Gray literature can include academic papers, including theses and dissertations, research and committee reports, government reports, conference papers, and ongoing research, among others. It may provide data not found within commercially published literature, providing an important forum for disseminating studies with null or negative results that might not otherwise be disseminated. Gray literature may thusly reduce publication bias, increase reviews’ comprehensiveness and timeliness, and foster a balanced picture of available evidence. Gray literature's diverse formats and audiences can present a significant challenge in a systematic search for evidence. However, the benefits of including gray literature may far outweigh the cost in time and resource needed to search for it, and it is important for it to be included in a systematic review or review of evidence. A carefully thought out gray literature search strategy may be an invaluable component of a systematic review. This narrative review provides guidance about the benefits of including gray literature in a systematic review, and sources for searching through gray literature. An illustrative example of a search for evidence within gray literature sources is presented to highlight the potential contributions of such a search to a systematic review. Benefits and challenges of gray literature search methods are discussed, and recommendations made.},

 abstract = {With evolving technologies, changing requirements, and limited budgets, governments and industries need to consider new methodologies to help streamline program lifecycle management, from cradle to grave, to ensure projects are delivered on time, on budget, and to the expected performance standards. Traditional approaches fail to adequately address the added complexities of System of Systems programs such as integration, interoperability, and variable lifecycle of subcomponents. The objective of this study is to assess and address the research question - can a new acquisition approach be designed to address and improve program lifecycle management of complex systems? A comparison study, using the Modified Delphi Method, of this new approach to the traditional legacy systems engineering approaches of the Agile Framework, Evolutionary Acquisition, and Modular Open Systems Approach was conducted to validate the conceptual framework. The Genetic Acquisition strategy establishes an improved methodology to embrace uncertainty while focusing not only on the quantitative technology deployment but also the system's qualitative user adoption, thereby reducing risk to achieve cost, schedule, and performance objectives of a complex program. This ensures that any implemented technology remains “best-in-class” throughout the lifecycle of a program to address the gaps and historical failures identified through qualitative research.},

The future of AI is promising and is offering a wide range of opportunities for scholars and academics. Although the theme has received a considerable attention over the last years, much has been speculated and little is known about its impacts on the Public Administration. Thus, the purpose of this article is to make the result of those impacts less ambiguous. To this end, we have conducted a systematic review to provide a comprehensive analysis on the latest impacts of AI on the Public Administration.

@article{saklamaeva_potential_2024,
 abstract = {Scaled agile development approaches are now used widely in modern software engineering, allowing businesses to improve teamwork, productivity, and product quality. The incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) into scaled agile development methods (SADMs) has emerged as a potential strategy in response to the ongoing demand for simplified procedures and the increasing complexity of software projects. This paper explores the intersection of AI-driven assistants within the context of the scaled agile framework (SAFe) for large-scale software development, as it stands out as the most widely adopted framework. Our paper pursues three principal objectives: (1) an evaluation of the challenges and impediments encountered by organizations during the implementation of SADMs, (2) an assessment of the potential advantages stemming from the incorporation of AI in large-scale contexts, and (3) the compilation of aspects of SADMs that AI-driven assistants enhance. Through a comprehensive systematic literature review, we identified and described 18 distinct challenges that organizations confront. In the course of our research, we pinpointed seven benefits and five challenges associated with the implementation of AI in SADMs. These findings were systematically categorized based on their occurrence either within the development phase or the phases encompassing planning and control. Furthermore, we compiled a list of 15 different AI-driven assistants and tools, subjecting them to a more detailed examination, and employing them to address the challenges we uncovered during our research. One of the key takeaways from this paper is the exceptional versatility and effectiveness of AI-driven assistants, demonstrating their capability to tackle a broader spectrum of problems. In conclusion, this paper not only sheds light on the transformative potential of AI, but also provides invaluable insights for organizations aiming to enhance their agility and management capabilities.},

 abstract = {Credit card fraud, a significant and growing problem in commerce that costs the global economy billions of dollars each year, has kept up with technological advancements as criminals devise new and innovative methods to defraud account holders, merchants, and financial institutions. While traditional fraudulent methods involved card cloning, skimming, and counterfeiting during transactional processes, the rapid adoption and evolution of Internet technologies aimed at facilitating trade has given rise to new digitally initiated illegitimate transactions, with online credit card fraud beginning to outpace physical world transactions. According to the literature, the financial industry has used statistical methods and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to keep up with fraudulent card patterns, but there appears to be little effort to provide neural network architectures with proven results that can be adapted to financial legacy systems. The paper examines the feasibility and practicality of implementing a proof-of-concept Perceptron-based Artificial Neural Network (ANN) architecture that can be directly plugged into a legacy paradigm financial system platform that has been trained on specific fraudulent patterns. When using a credit checking subscription service, such a system could act as a backup. © 2021, World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society. All rights reserved.},

@article{sullivan_moving_2021,
 abstract = {Background Queensland, Australia has been successful in containing the COVID-19 pandemic. Underpinning that response has been a highly effective virus containment strategy which relies on identification, isolation, and contact tracing of cases. The dramatic emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic rendered traditional paper-based systems for managing contact tracing no longer fit for purpose. A rapid digital transformation of the public health contact tracing system occurred to support this effort. Objectives The objectives of the digital transformation were to shift legacy systems (paper or standalone electronic systems) to a digitally enabled public health system, where data are centered around the consumer rather than isolated databases. The objective of this paper is to outline this case study and detail the lessons learnt to inform and give confidence to others contemplating digitization of public health systems in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This case study is set in Queensland, Australia. Universal health care is available. A multidisciplinary team was established consisting of clinical informaticians, developers, data strategists, and health information managers. An agile pair-programming approach was undertaken to application development and extensive change efforts were made to maximize adoption of the new digital workflows. Data governance and flows were changed to support rapid management of the pandemic. Results The digital coronavirus application (DCOVA) is a web-based application that securely captures information about people required to quarantine and creates a multiagency secure database to support a successful containment strategy. Conclusion Most of the literature surrounding digital transformation allows time for significant consultation, which was simply not possible under crisis conditions. Our observation is that staff was willing to adopt new digital systems because the reason for change (the COVID-19 pandemic) was clearly pressing. This case study highlights just how critical a unified purpose, is to successful, rapid digital transformation. © 2020 Verlag Hans Huber AG. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {Over some seven decades, a rather mundane transition that in its thoroughness and consequences has gone largely unacknowledged, has taken place, namely the revolution in modern information systems (IS) that guide organizations in their actions. Today, it is fair to say that IS have come to rule the world. They do this literally, by the rules they embody, which dictate how much of everyday life, as it relates to individuals and organizations and the transactions they engage in, takes place around the globe. In essence, IS have become important social and economic infrastructure. Seeking an understanding of how this has come about, I review historical developments in IS, focusing in particular on accounting systems, enterprise systems, retail automation, and electronic commerce. I argue that it is transactions and their facilitation that lie at the heart of IS and its development as a field of practice. I reflect on why this has gone mostly overlooked as such. I consider where we have now arrived with transaction facilitation as infrastructure and its importance in the light of current issues. I suggest how future studies might contribute to our learning more about where we should want to be with our transaction facilitation infrastructure. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

This step develops a model that depicts the interaction of the various components associated with the system of interest. This model is a collection of causal loop diagrams that will foster the development of a novel framework known as the enterprise lifecycle model, which will support system dynamics analysis through three stages: planning, development, and execution. Peer-reviewed academic and industry sources will be utilized to understand how accepted literature defines this analysis. Specifically, this model will be based on the Vee lifecycle model as well as the Agile and Iron Triangle frameworks. Supplemental elements will be added to these diagrams to incorporate the environment within which the system of interest is planned, developed, and executed. Additional factors, such as quality management, will be added to complete the super system and system of interest views of the enterprise lifecycle model—with the goal of creating a model depicting a reductive and holistic view that aids in the reduction of complexity surrounding the systems engineering process used to prepare legacy systems for evolution into an enterprise and support the definition of the desired target system.},

In this paper, a cognitive IoT architecture based on FIWARE IoT principles is presented. The architecture incorporates a new cognitive component that enables the incorporation of intelligent services to the FIWARE framework, allowing to modernize IoT infrastructures with Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies. This allows to extend the effective life of the legacy system, using existing assets and reducing costs. Using the architecture, a cognitive service capable of predicting with high accuracy the vessel port arrival is developed and integrated in a legacy sea traffic management solution. The cognitive service uses automatic identification system (AIS) and maritime oceanographic data to predict time of arrival of ships. The validation has been carried out using the port of Valencia. The results indicate that the incorporation of AI into the legacy system allows to predict the arrival time with higher accuracy, thus improving the efficiency of port operations. Moreover, the architecture is generic, allowing an easy integration of the cognitive services in other domains. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},
